# RIFTer Core Principles Research

## The RIFTer's Way Philosophy

### Import disk — not data, but meaning
- Context preservation across development sessions
- Semantic relationship maintenance
- Human intent preservation in compilation

### One pass, no recursion
- Single-pass compilation architecture
- Prevention of recursive dependencies
- Cognitive load reduction for developers

### Each token is a breath
- Complete semantic resolution before progression
- Token triplet model: (memory, type, value)
- Breathing-rhythm development practices

### Memory-first architecture
- Memory governance before semantic processing
- Trust boundaries through memory contracts
- Role-based access control at memory level

## Implementation Focus Areas
1. Semantic token architecture
2. Single-pass compiler design
3. Memory governance contracts
4. Policy-driven runtime safety
