# RIFTer Project: Semantic Token Architecture POC

*Following The RIFTer's Way - Computing from the Heart*

## Project Overview

This project implements a proof-of-concept for RIFTlang's semantic token architecture, following Nnamdi Michael Okpala's RIFTer philosophy. The implementation uses the Two-Track system to balance foundation research with practical development.

## The RIFTer's Way

> "Import disk — not data, but meaning. Let the bytecode hear what the human couldn't say. One pass, no recursion. To recurse is to break the weave."

### Core Principles
- **Memory-first architecture**: Memory governance before semantic processing
- **Single-pass compilation**: One pass, no recursion
- **Semantic token preservation**: Each token carries complete context
- **Policy-driven safety**: Zero-trust governance throughout

## Two-Track Development

### Track 1: Foundation Research
Focus on understanding and documenting RIFTlang principles:
- Semantic token architecture
- Single-pass compilation theory
- Memory governance contracts
- Policy-driven safety models

### Track 2: Aspirational Development
Implement RIFTlang concepts into working code:
- Token structure implementation
- Single-pass compiler POC
- Memory governance system
- Runtime policy enforcement

## Getting Started

### 1. Start RIFTer Pomodoro Session

```bash
# For foundation research
./scripts/rifter_pomodoro.sh --track foundation

# For development work
./scripts/rifter_pomodoro.sh --track aspirational
```

### 2. Follow the 45-Minute Rhythm

Each Pomodoro session follows RIFTer principles:
- 45 minutes focused work
- 15 minutes mindful break
- "Each token is a breath" - complete work before moving forward

### 3. Govern Yourself Like a Human

- Respect cognitive limits
- Maintain sustainable pace
- Document context for future sessions
- Practice semantic clarity in all work

## Key Files

- `.riftrc.toml` - RIFT governance configuration
- `include/rift/token.h` - Semantic token architecture
- `TODO.md` files - Track-specific development tasks
- `rifter_pomodoro.sh` - Pomodoro development timer

## Development Philosophy

This project embodies "computing from the heart" - building systems that:
- Preserve human meaning in computational processes
- Support developer well-being and sustainability
- Enforce safety through architectural design
- Maintain semantic integrity throughout execution

## Next Steps

1. Complete Track 1 research sessions
2. Implement basic token structure
3. Build single-pass compiler POC
4. Develop policy enforcement system
5. Integrate with broader RIFTer ecosystem
