o today's video is very meaningful to me. It's about the oral cell. Let me just sort this out. I know my views are normally wrong. Uh but today's video is kind of having a heart here, you know, here. It's kind of weird cuz I think my here actually, but my camera is flipped. So I know it's here because I'm pointing here, but it's flipped my way. So it's like here. That's where the heart is. So basically, I'm speaking from the heart. It's like a a bubble, a speech bubble and a toe bubble. I could have a to bubble on the other side here. But you know it's about uh my new uh framework um for civil collapse mitigation like you know the people involved it's like it's like you know you are you are you are something you are something um you are something uh more okay basically I have to say this to you guys my business is just about healing healing people healing healing people not even like Gen Y uh baby boomers only Gen Z or starting from Gen Z you know right you know you guys are the first point you guys are the point of my business you know you have to be a team to be Gen Z, you know, I'm a policy now. You know, it's a policy to say a policy, you know, I don't want anybody um anyone that's a Gen Z is my age. So, I'm basically uh 1997 to 2012. Uh that's Gen Z range. Um so, if you are below Gen Z, you are allowed, but you know, I think you need your mom. I don't know your dad, you know, some kind of um consent from this video is very important to me. It means a lot um to me. Uh this about my my personal development framework. Okay, let me let me begin here. I've got uh transcending. Transcending. What does it mean to transcend? To me, the word transcend doesn't to transcend does not mean anything. It doesn't uh I can't put the word love heart or transcend something like you know to go above and beyond. I can't formalize that. you know there's no framework and law to say I transcend something I become more powerful you know I I can have all the power in the world but I never transcend my um self you know uh I can't formalize what is a love I know love is made of um love for brother and sister um that's love but my business about love is not about love it's about healing you know I can I can say um direct destruction healing can fix itself you know rebuild itself and you you know based on genetic algorithms but I can't say the world healing uh formally means that you know something gets fixed something get done in the uh because I know I can define a formula I'm a scientist I'm a computer scientist I'm I'm a bio engineer I'm a bi technologist I'm doing biotechnology uh for my PhD but this video is very important to me I want you guys to take it with the most sincerity and try to find meaning you know it means something to me I'm autistic if you're autistic ADHD asperist and learn this mean something to you too just naturally you know maybe you can cry with me Um okay so basically it's about transcending the system okay it's about oral cell so basically is your oral cell insignia insignia you are making insignia you're making your own you're branching from the system inside no in sign like in sign inquiry so when you make your own aura insignia this was or sign in sign basically I was in social care I was inside I was inside so it's both an oral you know so you can make your own logo and start your own uh reform uh change organ reform which is my uh how does care reform 18 to 25 K etc etc they wasted my life and they're laughing at me in the back and those are the councils I hate them I hate them like the gut of my I called them for my section 189 8 a b a b c d and that means I need to get a free house in Cambridge they're not doing a job they're dragging their feet I'm going to sue them for them you know they don't understand it you know I don't really care for about them you know what is £1,000 2,000 the computer systems online check it moneyclaim.org uh file for bankruptcy file for human rights you can do that online tell you know it's never on ads it's never any anywhere you know can translate it if you want right now you know just make sure you do a system benefit make sure you do it properly you know which they never teach you how to do so basically my claim is uh 36 million pounds because you know the I'm claiming 36 million pounds but I have to give the rational so let me introduce you to drum roll please what I call the retical rational framework uh rift uh it stands for rift is a fical trans that's a matching thing but you know the retical rational framework is just a it's not even a theory a framework I ever should make it a theory ever again you know so this is the real world so basically my lawsuit for being molested harassing social care and all of that is really um you know when I didn't sign up for social care um when I was 9 years old and didn't go to medicine didn't go to Oxford I'll come to that later but this is about solving problems really for yourself in the real world. So basically what is a rhetoric? A rhetoric is a rationale like you know something you put in a problem statement proposed gap and a solution and that gap uh is the problem you know that's the problem there the thing stopping you the bridge you can't cross you know you don't understand what is stopping you crossing this bridge you know that's the robot it's not like the bridge is linear you know maybe you need the maybe the bridge is you need a boat not a bridge you know maybe you have a problem there's a big gap between where you're going where you are and where you're going is a problem you know you know a big gap somewhere physically in person or not. That's the gap the the person disorder. So mitigating persona disorder with persona. You can see it here. You know this mitigating this title here mitigating persona disorder with like you know people that are crazy that don't this classified wrong. You know give them medication. You're crazy take more medication and they fall for it. There's nothing wrong with them. You know there's no rational. You didn't ask them to um to review you tell you what they did in person. You know you know this what the rational. I have a rhetoric. What's your rhetoric? Your you're crazy. You just want money, you know. I'm not the crazy one, you know. And then begin psychology to start using uh um dark tricks on you. Things they go b to do against things they have os to do, you know. You know, I I understand the social care. That's what happen. You know, this was very personal to me. So for me, uh the thing about this is to explore the personal development with authentic persona development. Explore personal um mitigate explore and mitigate persona persona. I guess explore yourself. Why you going crazy every day? Why they say you're crazy when you're not? You know, bas positive, true negative, false positive uh coherent systems, coherence. Make sure you're all right. You're all right before you ask a doctor, you know, anything else. You know, look at yourself. Don't ask a doctor for your health. You know, doctor doesn't care about your health. Don't want money. It's money want, you know. sitting office is doing nothing just come in take medication that's that's a bare minimum building yeah okay so basically migating person using a retical rational for PP active assistant the phological principle or PRP is what the P framework is doing so the PRP principle you can use it as a protocol so smart I am phenological lensing protocol you know the protocol is just you can communicate with yourself by doc yourself you don't get a just means subject. Who's that subject? Basically, I can say I have a car, red car. I know you have a blue car. Those are cars, you know. But my red car is just red cuz it's just one different for yours. Then I keep it red cuz I like red, you know, and I prefer red, you know, different, you know. You can like blue because of your history, but same car. Just that's a minor distinction. It's a big difference for you and me to not distinguish our cars, you know. the same instance model you know okay now object new divergence uh new divergence integration uh so basically neurody divergence new divergence ADHD this is how I think in my head you know for me okay let me just give you uh persona developer I have to so for me I I'm an avatar right now if I if it goes big million pounds you know I don't really care about the money I become like Mr. beast all of them, you know, and then start doing the B. But, you know, for me, it's not about that. It's being authentic to myself. No, that's what I'm saying. I understand psychology so much that the money can't break me. Money can't touch me, you know. You know, it doesn't mean anything to me. It doesn't mean anything because I can, I have a framework to heal myself. I know what is going on with me, you know, you know, not about getting money even, it's about solving my own problem, you know, you know. Uh, so pursu. So, basically objective to explore the avatars. Avatar just means like Lisa, uh, Think all these people are avatars. I'm an avatar. When I become an avatar, I'm a king anyway. I'm an avatar. Personal disorder avatar. Uh okay. So basically avat Eminem or like uh someone that died uh 6ix9ine 69 that got in prison you become popular. Your stories got told everywhere. If you don't want to be told, people say, "Oh, this is this is sens people people with authentic personas have avatars or authentic avatars, you know, avatars. You look up to them. Look up to them. Keep looking up to them for what you don't need an avatar. You are your own avatar, you know. So, basically, I'm saying the you when you become your own avatar, you have to sign it and sign it. You have to have a you know, see this is not right or this is wrong. We're doing this way. Maybe we should explore this avenue. You know, it's about healing, you know, because you know, you can do it yourself. No, just to understand the B is not the end of the battery provided. So don't add I'm I'm angry at them. Okay. So basically the the thing about this is for me to understand the radical rational. So what is the correct rational? Just do it. Just do it. You're just a node in the clock. You know, you're not bound by contracts, anything. Anything you want to do, just do it. You're a node in the clock. Basically, they are the clock. You're But you know, you know, you want to transcend just to leave the clock. You know, you have to start leaving the funnel that's we squeezing and clogging everything because it's just it's a [ __ ] Not a clock. It's a [ __ ] It's just like a a screw, you know. You know, it's dangerous, you know, because you can break everything, you know, and that's what I want you doing, you know. Uh, just do it. Um, basically, um, uh, just do it. Uh, northern club slum. B, they call you slum or cannot work. You're clock. You're cog, you know. You know, you're just not bolt. You're porn in a game. You know, you know, you're nothing. You know, it doesn't mean anything, guys. You know, you know, just look at yourself. You know, it doesn't I talk to myself all the time on YouTube. you know, so I said, "Oh, you're so noisy." I said, "You're not normal." I said, "Okay, give me a mathematical proof to verify I'm not normal." And then if that proof is not correct, I'll sue them. I don't joke with my human rights guys. I don't joke. Uh then a uh they call you 304 of 304. You know, when you flip the 304 side down, you type a 304, flip it upside down. Yoohoo. You know, I used to do that car. I actually do hello you know I should do too you know well I used to you know I was like what is that my friend but you know my friend that's the partition about to give people insight to their knowledge you know but you have to show them not cose them to do it you know it's like antico if they already have the membrane oh this is all like a hole they understand that they can't be exploited when it comes to the real world because they're in a bubble you know that's what you guys you guys should be doing today you guys not doing I have a kid and you talk a kid ever in your life a grown man 24 years old. um personal disorder personal divide dividing people based on the beliefs everything look guys that's that's that's that's too that's too I don't know guys your problems but you know apart from the colonial history everything how I actually coping with like dividing each other I don't know you know because you're dividing and conquering money but it doesn't mean anything to me I can never get to if I wanted to you know I can become a counselor and get money and give me worthy because uh so right basically what people write because they should write you know anyone should write more right you know right framework you know you know everyone should write people only you know but write it authentically you know whether you hate something or you love something you know you know when you really really hate it and that's authentic for you just put it down as you see it you know and don't close this chapter don't book just try and put on the internet you know try to get to share with someone you take a picture of I wrote down about BF about my history being harassed you know about Niger not being a country um and then the US philosophy you know because the people Nigeria I call them you know they they are them to us you know uh the 1976 1967 that's three years war that's not three years war that was 50 years war you know it's still going on they never they never declared an end you know you know you know that's why it's still killing people because they basically they say the war is over but you knowce Let's declare the war end. I can say tomorrow that war is still going on. Why? Because I'm a politician. I'm a I'm a diplomat in the Nigerian people and because still going on under the mandated time was never closed. You know formally everything was aligned you know Nigerian you know we keep killing it's over 50 years war in 2025. I think this is 9 8 of 11 you know but I'm not fighting them directly. I'm building the infrastructure you know if I want to fight I want to build first you know to build my army you know I have to build up power the power I need to do it but it's not about the power I want you know it's not what's the power only myself you know is building as well you know these people don't care too much So what I'm saying to you is about authenticity. I can be angry for my homies or anything but for me I'm a man. I see myself as a man but I'm a woman too. I have feminist side because genetically I know I'm biologically the way I tell people I am a woman first before a man. You know I don't know about you guys. But the thing about all this whole thing I don't care you know it's about authenticity. You know are you going to do this? Are you going to do it quickly? Are you going to um pursue it? You know he can let no stop the word no stop you guys because you know no doesn't mean anything you know you know doesn't mean anything you know they can't prove no means no they can't prove that no means no in the real world they can't prove that proations but they can't prove that you you when they say no to you cannot do it you know cannot prove that human you know um so you got to transcend a cycle of oppression and discretion which is one uh album two is like my utopia so my my My utopia my mytopia my dystopia my dystopia one and then I'm making music basically uh album two is my utopia and then my three is transcending transcending the system okay basically I think basically one is my dystopian my two is transcending the system and then uh uh album three is um my utopia which are three albums in a 3D fashion you know say no to me I writing So basically the thing about this understand the uh writing based on the gating principles you know and the and the nm at you know you know xyz xyz system for like modeling language you know you know inse language basically x means like unit test language you know unit just for informal to factual informal to factual and then uh factiction you know dilemma uh and then y is like uh um up down. So if you go to uh true or false true or false you know the validity of that statement other expression and intent and then that's x y and then you go to z1 which is z1 which is the pulling of insight into your word how does it mean to you what does actually see is this right the morality how you frame it using the github.com rrf which stands for retical um reasoning framework uh I'm going to put the full name there going to be better that way. Um, oh, basically, uh, guys, you know, when you're doing this, we actually trying to use the wheel instead, you know, I'll come to that, you know, it means a lot to me in this video. Uh, I my oath is like, if you go to the ocean repository, O A T A HS, you know, I will not become what sort out to break me. I will not be like you guys. I'm not your friend. I didn't come here again to get a house. I g a 9B. You know, they all have houses. They don't care. They tell me to go to the truck. I say I'm suing them. You know, they don't really care. I say it's fine. I really care. It's not my problem. You know, they're my business. Don't do business together. You know, these are people that I know from a child, the Gen Z, they just corrupt. These people can't be fixed. Don't power. And that's you know that's look look these people are harassing people too much. Not me. Not me. I come from I don't come from pop but I'm a king in I'm a king and I think I think I don't know that I human right I'm a king in check it guys you know I'm going there after my PhD my basically my oral sale for this initiative is called um I think I wrote it down here uh let me see I didn't write it down here yeah okay I wrote down other one it's called return of the richest and wishes of the return you know it's here you know it's my one I've been working through this video. This red one here. [Music] Okay. Basically, this red one here. Let me just find here. This like my oral cell. So, this one here is my cell. It's like it's like you guys know this should be doing you know even before you turn 18. my silk. Can you see it? Oral sale. Return of the riches. Riches of return. This one I'm going to go to uh Nigeria uh and return the riches, you know, riches of return. You know, return. Basically, I'm going to return to Nigeria and give of the return. You know, that's the over for this uh initiative. You know, my one is like our um reform uh healthare reform, our um basically everything from country. I want to write a book after the Wfield's build your own there is a country you know there is a country you know where's China's book there is a I have that book I never read it guys I did read a bit of it but you know it was like you know basically this man called I don't know his name you know was writing the about the thing that made Nigeria the Niger war the death of the poverty I want to go there to see that day and I mean I've sealed my potential was too much was too great for them to control anyway you know and that's what we do that's my child you know it doesn't mean anything you know if I can go to Japan go on holiday go to go to a place where I promise I actually care about without stressing my life okay but you know this man that wrote He wrote this country you know that was about from war everything he survived that Philip Muel you know people that do black uh black people that you know that that solve the um the uh problem you know um see parallelism when you execute that C program and you know that processor system in parallel He was he was doing what the job but he he didn't understand the he and this was Philip you know he just susion he frame you know he's a black black man a friend at heart I'm a be too you know I'm saying to you that people like us you know we are us you know basically the fix you know nothing really care about children them is the Euro people that have the majority of them anyways that have even the EOS that have turned against themselves us making the politics of them rubbish not doing anything human rights coercing people for money and priming people we do too you know we do too but you know it's because of colonism that there we didn't have that there you know I was you know basically one pound was equal to one my mom said it to me one pound one pound was equal to one You know before the war pre-colonial I call it the precolonial be it was blissful you know it was so beautiful it was like£1 what can I buy I can buy anything in UK I can buy UK there's no point of going anywhere else to do it if you can do there's no point Nigeria anyway for a better life which was the better life there everyone could get everything sorted out you know what I'm saying so basically this is my or this Um this is one uh up life work uh okay I'll come back to this uh documents later do this now uh so basically transcend cycle of oppression you will go up about rise up rise up you know I'm not saying that as a motive is formal framework you know it's math it's math you can calculate it calculate it okay uh this is now your three hole doesn't mean nothing guys you know basically why you call three hole uh For me, for me personally, I I I'm autistic, you know. I went to Manchester, I went to Cambridge, I went to uh Kent, and then I went to uh uh I passed all of those places, you know, just for the uh for the 36 million pound lawsuit, you know. Now, you have to say, okay, I didn't make more mistakes. I didn't get strategies anywhere, you know. Now, I say, oh, you're wrong about autism. Autism is a superpower. He proved that he can go anywhere for his master's thesis or PhD, but it still means to get rid of the council with the Council is the problem. You know guys, these people are the problem. Now, you know, imagine because I've already transcended that, you know. You know, I have all the videos on YouTube every day. You know, for me, I've transcended I could just hidden everywhere. I always doing secrets. But, you know, I don't want to do that. I'm make this video for you guys. You know, I want to show you guys a better way to live. I want to show you guys how things are. You know, whether the law says autism disability advocacy, you know, have to get rid of the give you autonomy and independence like you know the right to act on something to do something yourself not the advocacy that I've already done the hard work myself number you know basically the case number they give you you know that's just number that's money in your bank account you don't know human rights you just oh it's a number case number a case when they ask for case worker case number ask them for case worker when they ask me okay give me an independent advocate and say me there's no I'll say to you um thank you very much it goes to court guys watch the videos on YouTube you know basically this phone here guys remind me this phone here all the evidence I have to get all the data from it you know already up there I'm going to put on the internet anyway but this phone the memory has a data this is called this phone here what phone is Samsung phone that's what I'm saying the the camera that's what I'm saying you know this was the one I used when I dropped everything you know I used it you know smart so for me it's about pressure and depression you know I didn't make one mistake they say there's nothing wrong with neuro diver now the law you know is love they make this love you know we have Use that case number everything that incriminates you against them. You have to flip the script. Flip the whole narrative. Tell your side you know. So why don't you do ABC don't go don't run away say give me a case number I'm your problem now solve the problem I'm going to solve the problem you know and do my own thing you know you know just say but you know I will not be that basically now I don't try to make it better for you guys. I use my brain you know this is basically I went to Cambridge court send out to me section 203 you know just that means like they didn't want to give me 140 now if I go to Cambridge court by email they million one human rights million sign up sign for that you know harassion 1 million poundals uh one human human rights 30 under health which is health sector healthare 2014 uh healthare 2014 child institution 30 human rights violated one year one stay in there that's 30 million beorical rale how much damage worth the damages damages to damage you know you do wrong I sue you can't do all the damages online but you know you can do on moneyorg We can't do online physical build and then the health services and social services 30= 60 million 60 million my time is now our time is now my time is now but your time I don't know uh my time is now uh but our time is now if you want it to be uh 60 million and then under someone's under social care and health care 30 million under health NHS health mental health you know together 16 million that's 120 million plus being uh plus getting denied homelessness under section 184 * 2 that mean 30 million because that's the act now the act one that's 60 million total making it 120 uh plus 60 plus 60 uh 180 160 170 180 130 140 130 140 160 160 170 180 190 190 190 million and then um you know that you know they don't understand the system like I do. They're playing games with the real world and they social care and then that's when they care department in the uh thing under the housing then the housing act um uh you know but it's 360 because um you know it's just whatever happened to me as a child because you know if I do something now I will never leave I'm going to came to do my master PhD and they can't slow me down and they can't stop me try to prove try to prove nothing about it you can write emails but against them already. Now the government should handle them government 2021 A4 was issued 262 that makes 84 days. 84 days you can use EA to check that you know you know A4 84 days uh by the third week 21 days put 203 in and you get what uh uh go But you know the goal is like for you to understand how you're going to solve your problem. You know that's why I'm a writer. You know writing is a trilogies are beautiful. You know mas one I wrote you know those are beautiful. Uh that's what I'm saying. Uh so I'll come to that later. Uh oh 15 seconds. Okay. So this is something else. Okay. So back to So basically yes. So the thing is uh uh as request I am I am polygamous. I do that mean I want two women two wives one doesn't matter I'm looking for authentic relationship you know I'm looking for relationship that sustainable for me you know I don't want my work life breaking it and saying it's a vow and you know I don't like your nonsense you know you want a relationship for life you know get you get when you're 30 you really mature like a man you know uh 36 35 uh anyway I come to that you know 35 after you finish being an elder you know get a children you know you don't need to have children you're doing I don't believe in Um basically 25 20 years is too young for children that's too young. Even 10 years I swear it even 10 years trust me guys you need it you prefer it you know you know have relationship good relationships you know can't be working you know in this world without relationship you know every time try 10 more years you know if it doesn't work for you okay try to 10 10 to 20 years try to 10 to 20 years you know that make it when you're 40 10 that be 20 something now 20 uh 10 years 30 I've been middle age woman manu In 40 years, I'll finally get married. It's fine. It's fine. I get a I get a I be polygist. I get a wife and two wives and I get a wife and a husband, you know. I I can be poly. I am you know because I see a woman is a woman woman with a womb. A woman man with a womb. That's you know and a woman can be an avatar too, you know. You know, but you know a woman is just a plain one. A man is just a plain one too. We are just um silhouettes. anyone for me anyone that's naked in just a solo it's just a plain person you know but you know when tattoos or like rings are band you know then it become someone I see them as oh you I put this I put this tattoo on you for this wedding I put this ring on you I give you buy this bag now you look like someone I can relate to someone I can protect someone I can have as a as a partner someone I can trust you know but you know The goal is the biirectional relationship. You know, can't just give a woman everything the wish of time anyway. You know, you know, we can give them authenticity. We can give them, you know, you don't have to give them anything. You don't have to make anyone happy. I don't want to make anyone happy. I don't care about happiness. I only care about what's in the books and that works. Nigeria, but you know, for me it's like uh about being authentically another one. Okay. So, basically Liz was like I was talking to Liz in the room video. I think it was like a day dream I had uh the the dancing by I think it was like all right video I want to be your right but you know that was I but that was like for me that means something was symbolic because you know I'm polygamous I can't just be with Liz alone if I'm with her I was like I want to be with Liz and someone else you know I want to be poly I'm eyeing the other women why because it's two of them you know because that's for me but you know for me that's what it means to be authentic you know be myself you know for me I do things It doesn't mean unconventional. It means like if that works in a stand way that's my conversion how basically um it's not about basically I can have two wives because it's better for me to have two wives you know because they can I don't cook for me nothing but they're authentic they can cook everything but you know if one doesn't cook for themselves they don't cook for them you know you know for me I can cook everything but you know the problem one wife is they get tired you know you know it doesn't mean anything about living the best life you can it's not about kitchen nonsense you For me, that's what I mean. No one should put in the kitchen again. My customer thinking like I'm not smart. Then we go um okay so basically guys 20 years old 20 years old 20 to 40 years old you get exempt you don't have to get into marriage relationship just say 40 years I mean parents I don't want to I don't have children just leave me alone you know I don't have your business have sex with you know just just you know just be just be authentic to you guys you know 40 you know when you're 40 years old you're really um starting to uh get to 50 and that's like uh uh uh 100 years is the 110 years is the first 125 years 120 years 100 years just people live but 80 years is UK and die 80 [ __ ] but you know 100 years is like typical Africa but the problem is like we don't preserve ourselves now you know so basically thing about this is like the thing about this you have to be yourself you know the Will the basically the civil collapse initiative one github.com will this the will initiative this one okay basically you guys are the network I want to run for and they say no they say no I am the will I am the I'm moving forward on my life they can do whatever they want there I don't care but you know the will keeps moving forward you need to keep moving forward you know there's no if about it you know they will never sol your problem you know get worse and worse if it's not solved you know you know until it's never ever solved you know if I never if never solved my problem with money you know I'll never ever solve it but I've been planning this for so long so she just put in my bank account I s again you know these people should just put in my account what they do wrong in this country this way of balancing it out in the UK way of balancing it out that's the only now we give them this uh yes the will you're the will basically the will basically the will is perfect you're I'm perfect. I'm perfect. I'll prove it to you. I'm perfect. You are uh you know the world but the roads are broken. Infrastructure is fragile. You know, you know it's fragile. Easy to break. You know is broken because it's fragile. It's easy to break. It's so fragile. It's broken. You know it's just easy to break. Can manipulate it. You know um you know let's build new roads to sustain ourselves. You know that's the oral self. You know that's what the construction building new kind of roads you know for our generation for the next one. for your you identify the problem. Identify all the problems. You know, I'm building my roads, my future, my constitution. My meaning public my ig meaning uh um order law and order. So means public means law and eer that's the whole human right there fighting you know so you know that's the next step I'm building you know uh and then you know you are not the problem you guys are not the problem you know you try to move forward but going bounce back and you know rford and court you know which I went to you know I'm going to go when I go to my m to go to I still get and everything change everything I don't care but I still got a section 204 I can do I can make the change my section 2042 I can put this again I just want to give my money first 203 I'm so smart now guys Uh basically just same thing here is there. So basically the same thing here is there. It's like uh I don't want to talk about it. So I got this this my model or the wheel. Let's go the wheel. The wheel model. So you see this here. You see that wheel there? This is you guys. This is us guys. So basically my wheel I started here. So you see this one X1. This is the X graph. The X graph. You got like a two age two space to uh age two space to 26. 26. I'm 24 years old. 26 years old. 2 4 6 8. You can see this. But you know there there's a wheel there and there's an up there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 H. So basically my H is on the X axis my my height is on the Y. You know this about achievement. you know how we get you know for me I can say to me I'm age I should be 6'4 you know but you know this is really about education you know it's about saying to you that um you are not the problem you are perfect like me now but you know you may be perfect like me or may not be you know but you know the roads are broken the roads you know the infrastructure around yours is broken so basically you know have you learning curve the learning curve is like you know, it's not true. This learning curve is not true. This is not a true thing. This a learning curve learning curve, you know. Why is it not like this? Why is it not why why people who start here uh keep bumping up and down and making mistakes? They shouldn't be, you know, if they're perfect, you should just do, you know, cuz you know this a learning curve. This should be you moving up. If you're perfect, you know, up and up, up and up. No, guys, guys, this is what it should be. I'm telling you this is not what this this is wrong. You shouldn't be there. You should be bumping up and down. You should be meeting barriers. I could hurdles, you know. You should be perfect, you know. But the system is fragmented. It's fragmented. It's just broken. The roads are broken. Bump. We all bumpy roads and the rules are just fragile, you know. It's just too fragile. Too fragile. Um 29. Okay. Basically yes. So basically I'm not myself. Basically I was in Nigeria then I I you know basically I was basically some kind of cans. The I was doing this I had a pre work done for school. I was just putting water in a can structure. Okay. So, basically the cans. This is the cans here. These are the this what I built like I built water system. I built a water system like I I built it like this, you know. I built like this. This water system I build like uh this water system I built like uh you know it was like it was like you know 3 minutes was a worst problem you know I I'll just tell you this a can this a can I sip you can kind stuff like in a tripod in a the special accounts and the and the the things I can't exp woring of the worst case scenario. So basically I was thinking of slums slums people piling buildings buildings you know highest infrastruure I can do the building of the pilot of buildings or buildings time is now oh 60 minutes you know I have to post the video uh before it turns um let me just say uh in 10 minutes 10 minutes so I'm just clock 10 minutes uh 10 minutes should do it uh now let me just uh do 15 minutes uh do 15 minutes actually 15 uh That'll be 55 and should give me less than an hour. Uh so okay, basically this is the wheels here. This is what I was putting you know I was basically this is a fountain system for disping water. I go to my water is like in there just water around the worst case scenario you know if there's a lot of rain flood you know in Nigeria or slam you know the water just disperses you know this is like the where you can live you can live here for no reason you can watch everything uh like a Brazil slam or anything or like a Nigerian dy which I do have an but you know it's kind of stupid uh but you know it's so dense that the water comes here you rains here drop you L and it comes here and it floods here and because you need going to do anything you know but you have to wait up here cuz people buy up here for reason Nigeria they buy here up here because they want to survive you know they don't want the flood nonsense you know and some cost more if it cost more same for everyone you know they cost more corrupt and [ __ ] [ __ ] you know this problem is like ensuring that water flows from this top buildings into the into down you know into into the sewers there's nothing to do you know It's a big problem in every day, you know, when it's a high rainfall, when the right change of weather, when it's gen, you know, but you know, we don't have like a summer, winter like that. We have like um we do we don't have hurricanes, we have um storms. Uh but because it's tropical, we have like um storms because the environment is nice everything, but the it's really hot with them. But you know, you have to have queen do you have to it's because of new ecosystem. It's sunny. It's always sunny there, you know. But you know the problem with The worst day is that you know you have to understand that the weather is dynamic too. You know you know when it gets really dynamic prep you know and you know it's just a understanding water into the whole canister people get clean water clean water you know clean water you know because it filters it you know I'm still going to work on this project to Africa you know you know my competition and it filters it. When it filters it, everyone uh gets a uniform amount, you know, you can't tr it, you know, because it's designed that way. It's design. It's perfect. It's perfect. The good of this basically the straws were like the floors, you know, and one cam when you put a car, you know, you get an equal amount and that's the I saw this, you know, and this man u this man u this man that was um being paying for too much in Nigeria, you know, he was a Caucasian man. I was 5 years old then no I was five years old just five years I designed this you know I was just thinking that I just thinking that oh this is easy problem you know you know and I come I designed this I I modeled this I put a DIY project I didn't even know was a project I said oh this something I'm doing for work to see my teacher like it you know I was doing this you know and this thing was just a blueprint for now but this is better now maybe 10 times better you know because I I'm more smarter more knowledgeable but this is just a design scheme you know I said I did this I show my teacher she was surprised who done this I said Nambdi who done this Nambdi I was like guys I'm really happy with myself you know I didn't tell me because I saw this problem you know and you know I was trying to scale up I didn't money nothing you know there's no support structure you know you know in that you know so the rules were broken uh uh what else now um my video is now going to is time is now oh I got 11 minutes uh okay so now the wheels wheels So this is the way. So basically for me I was uh two years old. I was 2 years old. I was already trying to find stuff properly you know I was like one years old I think I open my eyes one years and two years belly walking and three I was walking properly upright you know. Uh two upright you know but you know uh upright but very falling down. So that was saying basically two is belly calling one told me was walking online but she started lying and stuff w you know finding verb I thought I could draw mom you know things like that you know I was very smart child you know I was doing a bit of math with my brother you know my cousin the English I was doing fanatics very well passing all the grades everything you know mistake nothing you just want to joke with my brother then I give one mistake and then give me a correction okay then Let me go. I shouldn't jump all these things education, you know. Uh you don't understand the purpose of it. Now I go uh now I go to um what do I go to? Time is running out. 10 minutes. So I get so this is my height. So the Y is my height again. The X is my uh age, you know, age. And then the up up is the height from four to four years old now. And then um 4 3 2 1. So six years old. Oh, I'm a this. So, basically uh 3 years old uh four years old, what was I doing? Five years old, I built a thing. I build a water thing and then six the water fountain and then six years old I was uh I was doing a I was I was a high set of thing in college in school. I was doing I was speaking fluent English. I was teaching people Ebo, you know, I was coring other people, you know, I was my teacher something my teacher didn't know, didn't you, understand how I could explain it to the pairs, you know, cuz they class five, six years old, I was doing this. Guys, your life's no joke. My life's no joke. show up to me and then six seven years old 8 years old 9 years old 9 years old I come to the country I go sats perfect cut to UK stats perfect score 100% perfect SAT that means like you just got a standard test uh SAT score I got that 100% no mistake no blunder no nothing perfect I was the perfect wheel I was perfect so basically you just no curve so me giving me all the education support which I'm claiming they didn't you know because I'm part two percent 140 and above 120 is the average you know and the start to drop you know 120 and then basically the bumpy basic road became bumpy you know I then went to Oxford at what um uh did apply which part time I was what 13 years old 13 no I was 13 years old I was a teenager why you guys doing uh trying to calculate math I was doing at 13 years old doing applied math writing telling stories working on uh physics problems that you guys don't really can't comprehend today even you know things like that I can give you examples of that but don't worry about that you know that's not what the goal of this video is smart uh and then uh and I was doing DIY projects I was doing them in my room as prototypes by by by 10 years old oh by 10 years old I was like in just the 13 years old basically in First gates I did like a podium a student p one two three the podium one two three I build some kind of a authentic podium I put like a platform where people go up you know and I go first in the model I used to m to build and I painted it and looks nice I was like this guy was a strong man this was you know you know I realized was authentic because people are not allowed to build their own m glue everything and people went to I used to sell the tape and people basically it's like an outlet but you know It's like you know it's like an athlete but you know they have their own podium because they they are the best of the best you know in like um Olympic sports. I can be uh Olympic disabled u something or I can be uh oh time uh 48 I can be the Olympic athlete you know athletes you know the Olympic you know the Olympian but you know this an equal platform of the podium but just their own style you know just type of podium they can put it anywhere they like you know because it's the Olympics games it's equity business equity you know Olympic system for disability and they just design their own podium. So this man design podium is authentic reflection of his achievement you know just walk up to the podium and be authentic you know and pose for the camera well you have your own style podium the Olympic people have they can design it anyh how they want to be represented for the win you know for the victory you know however the season they deserve that kind of attention you know I was thinking about us games basically you know pressure for me. And then for me, the wingman actually, you know, join a wingman, a man with a wing, you know, he was a he was a gunman, you know, that's called a wingman. And that person can cook corners, everything. He's the eye. He's the rule. He's a true eye that acts, you know, for the people that are ongoing the wheel, moving the wheel forward. You know, he's by the wing taking the gun to ensure that the next point of contact is safe. He's the one that that with the with the most important job to ensure the system is coherent for the uh CQB uh military training all you know that's what I'm saying CQB stand for close quarters battle you know just like a rooms like this uh then we go all that and then we build we build you know we build then we go up up so 10 years old 11 years Ox didn't part time part time I finished I join Oxford I join Mens I try to go again.
