This is my video. Three minutes, okay, basically this, this video is very important, okay, okay, guys, so this video is biological informatics. Oh, it's just taken. Oh, it's recorded now. Okay, so basically, this video is some biological informatics, which is like sustainable information. Who is Nnamdi.

0:58  
Work this better. Come. So,

1:07  
basically, my video here. So the first video discovery, so

1:15  
I wear diamonds to build the rebuilding

1:18  
of my sauce, some of the problems. Some

1:26  
of the problems

1:30  
have the brain. So basically, my

1:38  
PhD now,

1:54  
nobody Am I

1:58  
still, you know, myself

2:08  
and pictures Introduce

2:36  
my head.

2:43  
Strategies.

2:52  
Have many

3:00  
people that have no perception. I will try to image my head. To my

3:24  
head. get

3:29  
that thing out,

3:31  
there are no bridges To prepare myself.

3:40  
for me. My senses are. I feel myself.

3:46  
I can practice possible.

4:01  
There's actually

4:11  
this quickly, okay,

4:32  
this is not going my way. Nnamdi, I think I suppose this like right now, someone is posing now. I. Okay, basically my video started, yeah, recording it,

4:44  
temp concept, okay, basically, go back to our video. So guys,

4:52  
so basically this one's very important to me. So basically, guys, this video is very important because, you know the one, because you know part of this video, it just turned out to my speech, my system, anyway,

5:07  
PhD, basically open sense, which

5:16  
is like the site, touch, feel,

5:30  
tasteless.

5:38  
You collect the

5:50  
particular IP

5:53  
principles in Christ.

6:17  
Observed,

6:23  
smash. you

6:35  
must Know

6:44  
what you

6:51  
City is like

7:34  
you. Know, I

7:58  
But unreported,

8:23  
I think are

8:35  
pretty much an image.

8:46  
Adapt

8:55  
information. It's not Just know

9:07  
know, experimenting myself and doing that because. the

9:22  
here to talk today.

9:49  
Watch enough.

10:03  
something i. About

10:18  
I think also my mind is like

10:32  
that. So what's.

10:40  
have there is a positive

10:44  
charge, responsible charge,

10:49  
and a positive charge,

10:55  
but the other one Is Megatron.

10:58  
Now these two are just different models. Different

11:17  
have biological sustainable for different

11:32  
ecosystems. Course,

11:41  
I can. Supposed

11:53  
fully, of course, you few charter in here.

11:58  
They I should charge it here. are

12:15  
anything

12:25  
know the same

12:34  
way that conscious.

12:58  
guy, information wide

13:30  
System, I to meet this show.

13:41  
Field to me, which is like

13:49  
using Care Wave.

14:06  
PPA that that has insurance without breaking

14:27  
down the know,

14:46  
there's No perception

14:52  
like my Oh, the

15:08  
mind. See

15:16  
calculation.

15:26  
Know, I

15:38  
see one. The video of patterns at a time.

15:57  
This uh,

16:18  
how this system,

16:24  
I think ABC, if he does take ABC, ABC, one

17:06  
protocol force the as much.

17:23  
Okay, it's almost done.

17:29  
scent, touch, sight, smell, eyes, nose, them.

17:37  
mouth or taste this morning, one now

17:42  
with my other definition, looks like We did the

17:50  
Basically, yes, yes, me, like

18:01  
me. This,

18:13  
like me, how I, how I, how I Get some kind of permission

18:27  
from the input.

18:42  
Group like quantum

18:52  
approval to myself, to

19:11  
see. Oh. Thank you very much.
