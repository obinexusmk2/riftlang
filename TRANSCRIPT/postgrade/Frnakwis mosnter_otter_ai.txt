Speaker 1  0:07  
Okay, guys, this is recording, okay, yes, yes. Basically, guys, this is very important to me. This video, guys, this is called writers framework part two. This is story for PhD. I'm gonna patent it. I'm only gonna like tree market.

Unknown Speaker  0:24  
But before story, I mean,

Speaker 1  0:26  
basically, I want you guys to have this story. And, you know, try to stand this properly. You know, ob Nexus, heart obey in his heart, or soul in Igbo. And Nexus means connections. My heart or my soul went from connections, is a guy connection to other people with my locality, basically for a PhD on ontological Bayesian Texas infrastructure. This is filming video to ensure you guys understand it. Oh, it's never recorded. I can't hear my voice, okay, let me try to this one is recording. If it is not, there's a problem setting, settings, yes, audio, but microphone stream. I don't think it's hearing me. I don't know. Okay, is it really? Yes, yes, yes, yes. It is really, because that's this properly. So I can't, I can't mess up. I've just got this sorted out. Here, go, seven, here, yes, yes. So basically I can hear myself, but it's two volumes to it. So there's a muscle volume and there's a default microphone should be really, okay? One sound guys, yes, okay, perfectly. So let's go. So why does it important to me my PhD, Cambridge, ontological, Bayesian intelligence, which I tell my made up. But you know, it's very foundation. The muscles is complete. And if you go to github.com/o, B, I, N, E, X, forth, life patterns, the word patterns, because you get that at the point. Did you go to the O, B, I, Cambridge, find the word Cambridge in the folder. Can find all the flowers in that folder, because obviously the third Rising Phoenix is basically right in physics. You rise up, rise up. So this is me.

Unknown Speaker  2:21  
So this one, I'm happy with it.

Speaker 1  2:26  
So basically, so basically, I'm going to do story right now, because you just really understand the story. I don't want to say the words here, but, you know, I want to separate it properly. So basically, in the beginning, because jackal and Mr. Hyde and Frankie send two stories. Mr. Hyde. It's just like two stories in one now. So two stories took a different story and Mr. Hyde story, but the aftermath, because I didn't read the book of Mr. Hyde and how to understand that. So basically, new story, Dr Jekyll, Frankenstein monster. But you know, that was from him, but, you know, I'm saying also the end of Mr. Yston. I can't remember the name, but let's go that. So basically,

Unknown Speaker  3:21  
how this was okay, lose his disorder.

Unknown Speaker  3:25  
Okay, basically, Oh,

Unknown Speaker  3:30  
yeah. So the story I wrote it down here,

Speaker 1  3:33  
so, oh, this was basically, I really, he was in a ditch. Frankly, Stan was in a ditch because he woke up in a ditch, he might want to go back. Why was Frankie, the monster, the green company in the dish? It turns out he's a founder, has a bandit him and left with Mr. Hyde. Now, Frank is dying. Was in the grave. He was wondering in the ditch, you know, why he was dead, but he was come to life, but he was left to rot and die because it was frightening. Span. He lost his heart, but the condition was going through more disorder mental health is getting crazy. So he's good in himself. His mind, into the universe. But he faced the first problem. He first include himself into the universe. You know, make more of himself replicas, like robots or drawers or Jackie Jackson. But when he failed, he would just hide. He thought before he thought, so my he's, he's a hypothetist model of consciousness was ontological by your systems, ontological. When he knows the stuff, biased, biased, the system knows how to be biased and solve problem. Limits itself to give you more second systems, like a conscious system, consciousness, Oba, ontological bias architecture, things that are biased, they work for one person, but not the other. Neurotypical mind put the same Obi ontological, Bayesian bias infrastructure called as decent architecture, entrepreneur system. OBS, you know, Jacob worked on two years to do this, the fourth he woke up and he just did this, Frankenstein in a grave and frankly, human being. You see what? My father lost his memory. So the fault of the system, the reflection of the self, you know, of the self. Dr Jekyll was tired, shifted angry, you know, and horrible. I was alive in the process. He makes more feet, very much more feet to make the Frankie stand body. Because you could just go down for the grave. And the grave. And he was biased. The bias system working for him was this his trauma, his experiences, everything was, what was him and how he said that one day, nearing the PhD closure, the Master's closure, you know, even not the PhD, the Masters closes. He said, Frank is dying. Wake up in the lab. Wake up. You then put a needle in him, you know. And then person all the parts together. And then, like, you know, and such a little quadruped through him. And then he just said, Ah. And then they said, My creation, you know, my creation is born. And then he said, trafficked. Read this sentence was, eyes, your eyes are very powerful. Frank. He said, Don't mess up this, my PhD thesis, he said, in front of everyone in the crowd, for what is yet be, began, began, began what that's what he says. You know, this is what for what is yet to be. I became, I became, I became, you know, so you got mad everything. And, you know, he threw the body and I became Frankenstein. He got angry. Ah, smashed everything. He punched everything. He was like, oh, Frankenstein, no. And he shut down, Frankenstein, the little corridor body, you know, with something, kiss or anything. It's just like down with just a discharge, no, just like a church you got angry, also shocked. He died. Was down saying, this is a failure. This police a failure. You know. So what? What you know, really understand himself either. So he said, I'm gonna give up. I'm gonna, I'm gonna give up being a scientist, you know, I'm gonna give up being here. You know, I failed with my house. I hide between myself together and I failed with the rejection. But you know, he didn't forget. He didn't think about the infrastructure, you know. So basically he didn't first or basically he put, he said he fitted the first quote, to serve and protect. I have failed, you know, to serve and protect is very important to serve, or to serve myself and serve the people myself. I have failed, you know, because he put the serving ovens to himself and the people and protect himself and the people himself, himself. Yes, I know people as well. Now, me himself, me myself. You know him. People for him. You know, you know Frankenstein duality. I read this framework, you know, cut it to be a bureaucracy prototype, and he put all of that in a box and sealed it for someone else in the future to come and get it. You know, someone who understands it, you know. Then I picked up the first number, because when I come back, 19th of May season, oh, one I was born, but, you know, I didn't basically, I was reading the Frankenstein, Frankenstein, and I was reading and I found the criticism story,

Unknown Speaker  8:38  
you know, and how they interconnect from Wolf, you know,

Unknown Speaker  8:41  
become your autistic

Speaker 1  8:44  
so you So, basically, I'm being friended with autism, adverse and my life's ability, you know, investigating how consciousness, or, you know, properly, basically, which is conscious? Why not conscious? Why am I conscious? I'm thinking about myself as a child. Why? Why am I seeing this stuff? What am I here? Most important life, you know, good philosophical questions, nature of being ontology, you know, on Thursdays, of being my role, my talks, why I'm doing that goal. That's what means, you know, and I promise ontology. I know this because now I get it. I can prove it, you know, Beijing, Beijing, you know, probabilistic, not like on bias, no networks, network ontology, business systems, you know what is actually P, I became this one. I get the work to do if I have a girl right on stage. Ontological, Bayesian intelligence, intelligence, ontological, unbiased systems, ontological Bayesian architecture. In basically my young heart, when I was a child, I was wondering about my philosophy already, my opinion, my ontology might get into B, am I getting to a? You know, because I can't be here if I've not gone through something already, you know, if I must go through something, you know, might still have been my book. Because, you know, why am I still on this? But I'm not a dead mother things like that, you know, he's a young heart. You know, my young heart from all angles, basically, to explore the avenues of all of us. You know. You know. You know not what most of those segments of people, all of us, you know. Why are we all here? It's a purpose of always being here at the same time and same place, the same location. You know, even though it's a random process, you know, this random, secular city randomness to computer automatically, even because randomness is not stochastic, unless you get real noise. This you measure for what is it to be? I was becoming young heart Nnamdi said that,

Speaker 1  10:58  
basically I was wondering my heart come from Nnamdi to Mr. Heart or Mr. Obi or Mr. Heart or soul. Mr. Odinex is Nnamdi, you know, to preserve the Protect yourself, so not to protect, trust and serve, but to serve first and protect. But you know, if I serve myself and my people, you know, my community, and then protect them naturally, because you can put himself, you know, I said myself, yes first, but I saw my people next. Feed me so I can serve myself. I'm fine with it. To live, work, to life, first, working next, you know, you know that's working does not sustain me. You know, as much as me living, you know, I can live by doing to work, to live. You know, if I live first, that's my foundation life, initial being, the heart and soul duality, you know, you know, basically zombie of seventh, the up down, bulletproof zombie wave, basically, basically Frankenstein. So I didn't go the previous response, and I got Frankenstein together, and I come to the lab, and I looked at this, I said, Frankenstein. This was all right. Mr. Jekyl, but you know this my patterns on GitHub, the conscious audiences patterns. Dr Jekyll, right, but you made one mistake, one mistake, Reuben did. Oh, and he doesn't know, so that's the one mistaken that is all in the blueprint. And the blue the diagram was just, it was inverted, you know, flipping the work nest. In the version he's put life first, to serve, to protect first, and serve first, to serve as what is necessary, of course, you know, to show that the system understands who is built into, you know, your ontology, why it was built. You know, can never forget that your system doesn't encode a standard to clean its first or serving yourself first is better. You know, then the system doesn't work for you. You can, you can't copy, you can't include yourself the material into a system that wasn't built around you. You know, because you know, you know. So that's Frankenstein. Got Frankenstein, and they're good at working. This was not the criticism. So from the side, and same cracker noise when I was winning raining, I will

Unknown Speaker  13:20  
build ontological, unbiased architecture.

Speaker 1  13:25  
So what is yet to be I became. So basically, I put the electric charge on the Turkish machine. I then put a charge on Oh, it's not

Unknown Speaker  13:36  
Oh. I put a charge on the juice machine,

Unknown Speaker  13:40  
and then read

Speaker 1  13:46  
this word for what is yet to be. I became, and then, and then practice, I said, Oh, yes, that's correct. But my father says, In Christ, so Are you my father? Because you really remember the old thing you know. So my business about healing people, you know, Jersey only 1987 to 2020, not a bureaucrat. 20, they keep saying no to me. So how? Why my PhD reflection of who I am, the Franklin monster is now the old one. Because, you know, that's the old pointer to the old guy. Now, Jake was new, typical. You know, his mind is just normal, normal that you couldn't see all these collections I saw, you know. So because he, he thought about the money, you know, he didn't think about himself. You know, he's at first, you know he, you know, he couldn't survive the civil collapse of the money, pulling on his pocket, you know. And then replied, Yes, you are, and I'm now your new father. Let us build the new foundation for ontological, Bayesian intelligence, architecture and infrastructure systems. Now it's my time, sure, Frankenstein work. Basically, intuition of the architecture of Mr. Hyde is basically my PhD. My personal development is duality, obviously relevant. Basically, his persona was developed. Wasn't developed enough. Wasn't coherently developed. You know, he wasn't happy with being the critical and Mr. Hyde at the same time. You know, it could have been, uh, Wait, who's calling me? Don't call me. Sorry.

Speaker 1  15:15  
Anyway, guys, this is so, basically, yes, likely to stop now. So this is being, is you think about you authentically yourself. You're being, you know, that's my first oral show. The Joker, Mr. Hi. This person was stuck in a state of fatigue, annoyance. And being a persona. Masking is masking like a neurodivergent person just to get by with a new individual. But you know, who's a masquerading with the crowd the observing states is mad. He could be potentially in paranoid paradise, crazy, you know, probably they're crazy a bit, you know, but you know, they don't know how to stop Mr. Hyde. What was your fault? Don't feel duty. Basically, my PhD, my mouth is done. Who's telling me that I'm doing wrong? My mom. I'm not done with my PhD. My My PhD is on the duality problem of consciousness and personal development, authentic personal development. But after my PhD, she was calling me Mr. Good heart, Mr. Evil heart, depending on how you know, how I am. So basically the heart is just me. Can have an evil heart. Can have like a basically based on the RGB spectrum. Can have like a sea blue color. You can have like a dark blue color, but not the same color on similar because, you know, there's some kind of segment that means the sky, blue, sky blue, or sea blue. Bottom of the Sea a very red, blue. But, you know, it's blue, is clean blue. You can see is blue because he's translucent. But see blue, that kind of color perceives dark blue because it's night, or the same as the day in the sky. You know, because the same thing system. Beijing system for Mr. Hyde. And, you know, duality was living that Mr. Hyde was hiding, almost hide his persona. What was hide inside? You know, he was referring to get at the soft position. Couldn't hear Mr. Hyde voice. There's no coherence between Mr. Hyde and the critical, you know, they there was not a heart the head. There was an evil heart. There may not be an evil heart or evil agenda, you know, but you know, they're not aligned in the physical, spiritual sense. You know. They know that there wasn't Mr. Jekyl. Was not the scientist that was testing on himself, but still testing himself in the way that was, that was ontological and means of the terminal was purposeful for him. You know, he was just playing with drugs and all of that, you know, to see whether he can pull women to see the world for my lens, you know, phenomenological lensing principle protocol, basically, for you, now applies to old people, new damage or not, because you know how you see the world is based on how you understand the world anyway, because, you know, basically there's no image around you in front of you. You can store the screen. It's an image from information. You should get information by touching, by sensing it, your senses, tongue thing, suddenly you put your tongue. I can play that back. You know, you can, no, do you know? This is my robot. Is an Android. This is rd 2d, two. This is the Skywalker. This is a, basically, you got all of this every day, but, but, you know, you gotta know all of this is just the real world, you know? Because, you know, that's what I'm saying to you guys. It's not the fragment anything, just how it is. So my my PhD, building the system that failed all of us, you know, you know, like, even traditional, but I'm trying to make it up, you know, in a bunch of things about the past. You know, ontological, Bayesian intelligence, housing ontology, you know, things that fail me, like education, you know, I didn't care about the things I've never encountered. You know, four years old, actually, four years old. So basically, the Housing Act 26 the evolution program UK, you know, my 240 million pounds grant losses against our council and rebuilding the urban access, civil cards initiative for the housing money, empty for I have nothing. Silicon initiative, the wheel, all the stuff there on the repository, GitHub, the conference. You go to youtube.com, forward slash, at OB, nxus. Forward slash, see the more like social media platforms. But that's why my constitution will present my utopia, my vision for better money, exactly what only me for the my PhD for two years, and I go to Japan and go to Biafra, you know, because I want to go on holiday Japan. So I get one more year to breathe. So I see Japan. I do business there for one year, and then come to back to UK, and then from UK, I go back to go to Biafra and rebuild onitshita. Build omanbala states for the new people that are there, the children that the new Tiktok. They have the new Tiktok. They want to watch Tiktok. They want to go to the park and play without getting killed. That is going to do in the community. We want to stay in the country, called the Biafra. That's the future I'm building for them, not for you guys in the UK, even that agreed on money that the community opportunity you should be aware of friends, you know, you forgot about your origin, where you're from. You know, guys, you know, Biafra means a lot to me. BIA means come and sticks, come and take. That's what that means. You know, Biafra, come out, take up. It's not like a that's what that's what it says. We hear about war is war? You think, oh, Biafra only cared. We don't know what Biafra mean. You know, everyone say Biafra. I know. I know what that means, because the word means BIA BIA means come. Fra means take, Biafra. And BIA from Biafra.

Unknown Speaker  21:01  
We are BFR from the street. You know,

Speaker 1  21:06  
I'm Biafra. I am BFR, but I'm not Nigerian, because, you know, I hope you guys, hope you guys find this video. You guys understand it phenomenological or lensing principle, integrity. I found it explain how the information, my ontological patient systems, on YouTube, the conference, OB, Nexus, and all my other social media, please like, share and subscribe if you don't follow me, if

Unknown Speaker  21:37  
you want to Follow me, but

Speaker 1  21:39  
please don't disturb my life, my life.

Unknown Speaker  21:44  
Once get money to help me. Give me money.

Unknown Speaker  21:47  
That's fine. Let me store this now.

Unknown Speaker  21:50  
This should be done now, file, export, export,

Unknown Speaker  21:58  
logical version. I reason, architecture,

Unknown Speaker  22:22  
okay, that's fine. She stop this now.

Speaker 1  22:25  
No, no, if you can't stop it, no, no, I will go to my other one. Just stop it. But where's the other tab? Cool thing, yes, if I missed.
