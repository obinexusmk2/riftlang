Basically I must start recording today.

0:13  
Okay, okay, okay, guys, welcome back to my channel. Okay. Now two repositories I'm creating. Yes, the two reporters are for my own shell of initiative. The first one is the will. The will action. You are perfect. The will keeps moving. The system is broken. You keep moving. I'm good to Cambridge, whether you're lucky or not. By turn of January 26 I'll be there for 10th of November. We should think of November for two years for the 1000 masters for 1000 my PhD grant, you know, unless I go back to Nigeria, get the portrait, don't really give a shit, I'll do my PhD in Nigeria. Yes, but you know, getting all the money for that PhD, but, you know, I have to, like, try to get this thing sorted out now. So basically, today, I want to show you, if I ever read anything here, what's my what's my medium article, guys, what's my medium article? I never know. Oh, yes, yes. Basically, this my medium article, yep, oh, wait one second. Like rendering. There's no sound on this interface, so let me try to add audio device. Yep, and it should go up. It's pinned already. Okay, so there is one, but this kind of Lana, okay. Now, because I want to show you guys a poem here, and I'll try to find that poem. Because I wrote it. I I wrote it for my blood sweat, with my blood sweat and tears, my medium.com thing, because, you know, okay, basically, this is a poem I'm gonna read to you, but I don't know, use the reader. I want to read it outside to you because, you know, there's something, uh, messages there they want to capture to you.

2:03  
So basically, this is something called Spirit of the Masquerade.

2:08  
Spiritual The Masquerade might become, it might became. So basically, tick, tap the clock, tick, tap the clock. Hands cross towards midnight. I tap my pen against his tail till being patient in the crowd, a voice, like a solo voice guide me, a solar song, 530 tonight, which obviously that stands. It's like a first three standard first three paragraphs of stanza. So basically this, like, you know, my autism, New divergency, I'm masquerading, my masking, my masking, my masquerading, not masking, because, you know I'm masking. I'm masquerading my new divergence, basically my autism, EDG aspects and eligibility, you know, all in one. You know, it's like, you know my objective too, because I am tick tapping because I'm impatient, but I'm not tick tocking wrongly. I'm tick tock because I want to achieve something, you know? I'm not frustrated. I'm frustrated for good reason. You know, it's a mask, and I am a master reading which one is solution, because mask is not okay. Basically, why am asking for me? Why am I navigate systems now, like, I speak in a way that you understand, that's dug down, like, pidgin English, but you know, that's not my real way to speak, because not huge enough for me to relay information to myself. So that's why I call masking. Because, you know, I can mask within Anyone, anyone else, because I I'm so smart, but basically I can mask if I want to, but I don't master the time. So basically, when I mask, I actually try to mimic someone or something or some system behavior, just to get something out of it. You know, you know something like a species. The next paragraph says the next poem, check tap, when the cloud, when waiting for the last of the crowd to leave, I mutter frustrated science engaged. You know, I am bored of my mind. So basically, this the this for the github.com/open access

4:08  
what I call the repository. Yeah,

4:12  
it's very recent for the Nnamdi. So the first repository is called,

4:22  
I spiritual anchor. So, like, that's a spiritual anchor initiative. She got the will, and you got the rule, keeps moving, and you got the other one, the risk, cover you or discover you. Who you are. Who am I gonna have all this money, the money, the million pounds, so I can build my presentation? You know? Why am I? So this is the initials and dag structures, basically anchor initiative, etc, anchor my spirit. What's my spirit? Basically going back to Biafra and Nigeria and fixing the broken country called Biafra and fixing implementing constitutional causes and building an ecosystem in Nigeria. That's my anchor. That's why I'm building open access. So, you know, I UK, but that's my entire aura, and I'm watching the UK for my PhD, my roadmap, etc. That's my spirit anchor. That's my spirit, my spiritual Biafra, the suffering, the healing of people, the return of the riches, which is of return, which is what my ura is. Title is because, you know, I have to return to the riches of like the Biafra, and return the riches to the Biafra people based on my becoming already my, my journey from an adult to King child to other than adultery, King, you know. And then the other one is called a masquerade. Basically, I'm a masculine. Basically, they're all the same thing. So you got a masquerade. The bad actually, the masquerade is like a non masculine, because Masca mascara, we must you try to navigate something. We Masquerade. You join the people authentically. You try to try to become something better. You know, you don't join them authentic, just like a bypass the system to transcend it. You know, you don't get stuck in it. You know, using the same system, you bypass it, you mask the raid, and you celebrate. And then you get out of that system. You know, you transcend it, you know. So basically, it can have a spiritual masquerade and a spiritual anchor. So basically, being masquerade, you know, the mosque, you know. So basically, you know, you don't, you got a spiritual master repository, and you got a spiritual anchor to anchor your aura. You know why you are masquerading and why you have anchor to something, your problems. The finishes are always going to be your ownership. You got the Masquerade. The Masquerade is the seal to the other one, and got the uncle to the master it. You know, you are the authentic GBV, or take yourself via personal development. You know, I'm Mr.

6:55  
OBS. I got the Tiktok.

7:00  
The my thing working? Yes, oh, no, it's not working. Oh, this is working. So basically, basically it is working. Three to one. Go to video, three to one somewhere is like here. So this leads here, sunlight, kissing my skin, okay, tick tock. Midnight, at last, I cry with a segment roughly for my native attacks my Igbo way I wish to catch the fight. You know, the glimmer of the night lights the star in the sky actually locking the shop with desperation. You know, because I'm masquerading, no masking, and I'm masquerading sunlight kissing my skin, waking my body. You know, the sun energy, right? So beautiful. You just wake up when you're in this, literally, you walk out in the sunlight. You see the sun, you say, ah, awake, you know, you know, saying that kind of thing, yeah, yeah. Chance of people working my soul. You know, my soul, my bio, you know, because the buying philosophy of, you know, soul is not transactional. The soul is the buyer that keeps the heart going. So basically, you got the soul, which is the bio economy around this heart. You know, you can have a soul if you don't have a heart, you wouldn't have a heart if you don't have a soul, reflection of my soul, heart and everything. No. So, yeah, it's like a chant. It's meant to encourage the people can make in any way. You can make it in a sequence or, you know, so you can coordinate a chant, you know. But chanting is a it's not even spiritual. It's special too. So can we just pretend? Yeah, Queenie means like, I can't remember, because you knew I screamed back. So basically, it's just a reply. It's like a hail Hill queen who means hail, yeah. It's like, a bit, just like a queen who hail and a Yeah. Hello. Hello. The people around me, you know, tumbling twisted. I just turned into the majesty my squid. You know, I had to come. I am the Masquerade. You know, this was not completely spoiled, but it's good enough to use it, okay, the majestic Masquerade. I am not masquerading, you know, I am with my masqueraders. I'm with my people. You know, I'm with one more chance. I dance spinning with the winds, intricacy, one with the people, you know, basically, I just just transform it from like a magic one for the child body, and now have all the coolest tires, you know, you know, with the children. You know, some busy. The solution of the New York festival has started. One because, you know, this is so much better. One of the people, children, platform, ignite the fire my soul warmed in my heart. You know a fire, the fire in my soul, the masquerade to be warmed in my heart warmed being warm you are like you know happiness. You know, the warmth of culture of integrity, the biome being part of the of the community. You know, not being bureaucratically left alone by anti social money policies. You know, that didn't really solve anything in the UK trill into a viral side of my screen, on my screen, but you need this one. Then I look at it. It's never my image, twirling fiber, real colors. I lift us a bit. I slipped my leg, you know, but you know, that's I lifted up, you know? I just fall for four and then I spin, I transcend it. I'm caught by every lens, every camera, everything preserved with my spirit, my spirit anger, you know, which is like my images, everything I've taken my season two or three, you know, every angle operating accuracy, I bring new flavors into the cells, filling them with all Oh, wow, breathing new lives into the eye. Oh, this guy's so special. This guy's autism. You can dance, can sing, you can you know, he's part of this play. We know him. You know, whoa, excitement, the gifts. You know, they chuckled his mouth when it needs to lift. You know, food, water has to be just a gift. Democracy, the thing you know, you have to give them something if you're going to be watching them, because, you know they're so beautiful, you know you're being humanized by them. You give them everything if you don't have nothing, you shouldn't be there, you know. But that's the problem there, you know. You have to give them something when you come there, because you know they are they are working. They're dancing. 24/7, basically, they are, they are they're street performers that do this for a job, you know. And they are in Nigeria, but, you know, they do it and get paid for money with them. But you don't mind. They keep it, you know, because you're street performer, they are part of the biome, the biological and that's the thing, you know. It's not just for show. It's a, it's a cultural thing you can do, you know, you can do, like the thing chased by the voice a kid in blood, Guinea. Guinea means what? Guinea Pia, the beer means Calm, calm, calm. And like chasing this, you know, chasing the masquerade, which is me, the adult, the one masquerading, wow. Okay, moving with grace and precision. I'm admired. I don't even try the resolution, you know, basically my best project, you know, the one on the nature of a tie. Other things, you know, basically they're taking pictures of me. Everything I'm gonna put in, gonna have all that pictures forever, forever. And you know, never inspired, never like a spirit, you know. But you know, I know all the Twitter houses. You can get those switches back for the children, you know. But you know that's gonna be there forever. You know, whether the opening or not, because, you know, it's part of them anchoring their souls. You know, anchoring to the biome. You know, I'm fueled by culture, heritage and time on the transitions, you know, basically the time on those days that we cherish as a bio, as a culture. So therefore this is Igbo as a tune of Israel, as far as the evil tribe, as far as Igbo people, as far as Igbo constitution, the life worker dilemma. This would share this. We want to be committed this. We call ourselves community for No, we don't use words community enough nowadays anymore. I'm timeless. Timeless, timeless. Can't forget me. If you try forget me, you remember me because I energized you by values. You know, what will value, what we share. You know, you can't forget what we share together because, you know we are, we are one of the same in the biome. You know, there's no, there's no there's not many biomes. We are a constitution. We live there, we work there, you know, I'm talking about this proud celebrate by children. I give the life, life to culture, life to culture. You know, sovereignty. You know, basically the architecture is an infrastructure. So basically, if I give life to culture, I'm talking about sovereign design and coding constitution, like artist stuff, you know, my logo, like the Ebola ties, the butterflies, the battlefield is encoded into the into the wall, the blueprint of the ecosystem, which is black and white. You know, another dominance in the Constitution. Because, you know, you gotta be living there. You work in the you know, country. You know, be making quizzes to act, you know, you give the life. Basically all this other stuff in the Constitution are just there for you to act on them. Because, you know, you think, oh, I want to try to do this, you know. But you don't get dulled out, you know, doing this board, you know, you don't get, like, all the artistic, um, that's keeping my attention. Like, you know, it's like a child looking at war a white wall, like, this was, yeah, and they get both, you know, I hear this water basically, when I, when I, when I finish this room, when I, when I'm done with this room, I'm gonna punch holes in it, you know, I'm gonna, like, try and paint it angrily, about to get on the bed after, you know, just to quit my paranoid stage of not doing anything on the walls. And because I don't have time, I'm rushing up and down, up here, down. But my time is now 40 minutes. Okay, now go tell the tilt they give me right life, you know, basically the mascot, taboo, a treasurer, G What are things around the evil masquerade are based on the hero's journey, or heritage journey? Basically got the basically the heritage journal. The huge units are just the stories that are based on real world events. But you know, they come as things we don't understand as taboos become radical rational reasoning models for such because you basically, ever touch on something and he told something else, and he tells them. But you know that information is not coherent, because we don't have a coherent system to pass that information perfectly. You know, because I'm talking to a lot of people, to pass the message by voice. But you know that system, it's go to 1000 people, and the message will be like, distorted, you know, you can't get the message meaning that, because the history then becomes something else, you know, but doesn't really align, because to preserve all of that, because, you know, coherently, some kind of coherent form that will quote, art, culture, you know, we have to preserve that model. You know, if we lose all the information, whenever we get it back, you know, everything and it will start again, of race basis again. You know, to get the information back instead. Do not forget. Do not say our history, our belief in history, fall and failed, forgotten, lost. Don't forget. Don't forget. You know, even if you grudge this, people, against people, try to try to sort it out. You know, you know. Try to anchor your spirit. You know, instead of your and anchor your mastery. You know your mastery. No, don't basically a spiritual master, a certain anchor. You see mastery, and you anchor your spirit. My spiritual anchor is involved Biafra and lifelong constitution, or vinatis and my masquerade is what

16:48  
is me, my authentic heart persona, my authentic self, my Igbo dancing, my nature of being that's my master, that's my seriously these days, two things are me, the change of me, me becoming better and society, and becoming a better human being that's not in a room, that's been in a higher house, has been part of a greater system of moving forward this life. You know, a church making making systems better than basically, I'm quite busy building instead of distracting, you know, because, you know, mask myself, you can see what's wrong with wrong with him. If I must read, I have some kind of, basically, I've seen to you basically, that this basically, you know, say, like, you know yourself, if I see like, if I see like a bus, and I'm seeing patterns, data, you know, like, you know, I'm trying to have like, a gunfight in a bus, and say this guy's holding a gun, with a gun up the stairs, you know, but he doesn't realize they don't know that I'm something else. You don't know my full intent. So basically, they are saying it's just a crazy man doesn't know that they have a gun. But you know, me going on that fun bus, like, you know, maybe practicing some kind of a real world sport, like gun shooting, like, you know, a real gun shooting on a bus, or attack speed, something like that. You know, that's like my authentic masquerader. But you know, I'm masquerading. I'm not masking. I'm not being a, you know, if they hear me speaker authentically, and then they see me do that, then you think, oh, it's crazy. But you know, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying that the masking is if the masking is just hard to do, either if normally tell what I'm asking or masquerading, you know, because you know, if I'm masquerading, it could just ask me what I'm doing, but they don't ask you just because you just weird, like him. Am I Normal? No, no, I am not normal. I'm extraordinary. But you know, the guy I think being extra ordinary is what too much. So if you're extraordinary, let me show something more. You're a new iota of that infrastructure. You are your system. You become where you want to become. But that basically, basically, I'm hard to understand because I'm so small, but I don't have all the resources to do it with the money and the time and the right about so basically, that's like the triple investigation. I'm masquerading, yes, but why am I masquerading? Because, you know, they think I'm asking, why they think I'm asking? Reader, PRP lens, the way they see me, because, you know, I don't have the money, I don't have the time, I'm very smart and I don't have the resources, but that masking is not authentic. You know, I'm not masking. I'm masquerading. I am doing things my way, using my rationale to do it what I have in that time. Because, you know, I don't have the 3 million pounds now or any money, but if I go to Cambridge hotel, have that money, and I'll be like, but, you know, I should do that authentically, you know, with rationale, with a purpose, to do it to my network, to explain the system of being combustion, how to get there, to give my reasoning, how to reason my way through systems in real time, to ensure that my authentic persona is anchored and my Spirit is projected onto the correct people

20:05  
masquerade as a non masking tree

20:10  
development alignment and systems that ensure the work for the masses. If

20:22  
it strong everything,

20:25  
but we don't have all the artificial infrastructure, and that's what I'm saying to you guys to protect our sovereignty. You know, you don't have any checkpoints that are ground in a reason. I'm a rebel, yes, but rebuilding the right way, by rebuilding, not by killing people, by selling people doing dance, either, by literally just rebuilding what was never built. And in Nigeria, because they built the sound and they tear it down, you know, that's happened after the war, because you want to do it, so just chill it out so never go in a certain city. Must be doing these repositories, anchor, authentic anchor, to spread anchor, which is my anchor to something, my objective, my spiritual, my authentic self, to navigate that within the will, our model of will, initiative on the rediscovery initiative, okay, guys, thank you very much. This is a special remark with this might be coming up. Lifebook messages, constitution, okay, thank you guys for watching.

21:33  
This is just the poem In your form thinking you

22:20  
you I should do it. I should go to other AI.

23:01  
Now, down. Now, 321, stop, stop. It's not stopped. I think, okay, it's not stop. How do I stop it? I tap here.

23:20  
Maybe I should stop it now. I stop, stop,

23:31  
stop, now, stop. I don't think it stopped.

23:36  
Okay, so basically, from this site, so I.
