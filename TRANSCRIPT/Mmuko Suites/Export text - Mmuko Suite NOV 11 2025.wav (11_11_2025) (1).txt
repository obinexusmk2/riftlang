(00:05) Okay, guys. I want to just like talk to you guys about my systems. Okay, we're gonna start with onion. No, this is the onion system. No, no, no, no. Okay. Yes, we're gonna start with the onion system, but it's about mooka. Now, Muka is my brand name for my gaming industry. P-S-N, Polyglot Artichoke. Polyglot just means many languages. So the term polyglot means poly means many, glot means language, so many languages, many dialects. And the term polyglotic means any language system. It's about systems, like computer systems. Okay, now, introduction to muco. The muco is, I made it for two words, I can't remember the words. The mu is a low tone, and the mu is a vowel. So that's the MUKO suite. Now MUKO stands for the spirits of good and evil that connect. So basically the KO is connections you know it's made of two of MUKO connect so it's like you know OB nexus heart soul connections OB I equals heart.

(02:05) MUKO is the same thing but it's for gaming it's a spirit of good and evil that That's what MOOC means, that's the motto, and you can add your own tagline, you can create your own tagline here. For me, it would be like Combo Theory TV, Mr. Combo, you know, something about the, and I did just that, and I built my own systems. know people it's like it's really a gaming suite so you get like a Muko Muko engine dash engine or Muko dash connect let's start with the thing okay Muko dash connect spirit of So okay, so you get the Muko-Connect system, which is like the Muko, you get like a MukoSocials or Muko-Connect. That's like the system, the part of the system for connection on the, for gamers only. But the goal is like you build it around a fandom. The fandom is the people who express themselves with their own culture and everything.

(02:46) The fandom, the group of people you're actually selling to, the gamers, you know, the people based on the avatar as a protocol, you know, I'm tailoring this, this kind of unique avatar to someone who played red devil rations and understands this line of war in especially this line you know just think about the people uh i'm selling this kind of uh where you know it's about merchandise you know uh the goal of this thing is to have um the fandom uh which is the fans that that follow you actually continue to follow you and can grow your fan base you know you can build your own fan function uh but let's start there so you have to govern yourself too because you know muco is a platform it's a gaming platform you know i'm trying to release for ps5 right now and xbox and it's gonna switch so i can put out the muco services so you get muco connect or social media connect uh and you know you got muco engine uh which is a muco So the engines is like the gaming engines, all the engines

(04:07) that allow you to. For Neural Diversion First, of course, as a policy and all the socials as a policy, the goal of the fandom is to ensure that people are getting the service they need. It's saying that people can keep coming back to gaming, especially never leave gaming. When you play a game, you don't want to be, you don't want to have fun, even for like 30 minutes. You log in, you sign in for 30 minutes, So when I try to put a game in, I have to spend 30 minutes setting up, and then I have to pay ticket out, and then for 5 minutes, 15 minutes to play the game. That's just a standard 15 minutes, and then the timer runs out. Like one match in Call of Duty, it's actually 30 minutes, it's 15 minutes. So 30 minutes set up, 15 minutes it's like boring. So that's one strict rule that I know. I just come in, I want to play the game, I open my console, I just play the game. I defragment everything. You know, I don't even have to talk. So the goal of this is to have an onion system.

(05:13) Now, the onion system I'll get into now. But Muko Connect is a social media platform. Muko, or connect, is social media. Connect to Instagram, Snapchat, all your social media platforms. It doesn't have to be PSN. You can talk to any system. Muko Gaming Engines. This can be gaming and this can be social, which is more of an engine for social media, but you know, it's for new social media. Now you've got the micro-fandom. Now, equity is a key principle. Now, equity is like the principle, the first principle of, you know, equity is before equality. If there is equity, everything is a fair share, you know, because in the world of disability, The fandom is really based on the game design, the blueprints, you know, I've been creating for Polyglot Architecture and Systematic Version X, and all of that system comes together to give you a Muco suite.

(05:57) Now, so you're going to want a Muco suite, it's like, you know, basically a suite, S-U-I-T-E, is, you know, you can use the Muco engine without using the MucoConnect services, you know, because you can build on top of the service, you know, and there are more people to do. So basically, you guys are going to have to create a fandom, a fandom, join a fandom, and you're gonna start becoming part of that fandom, you're gonna get into it, and then you're gonna move on. But I'll come to that now. So the goal of this is to ensure the polygots systems is human-centric, you know, gamer-centric, you know, you know, avatar- let's call it avatar-centric, you know, human-centric, human-avatar-centric, you know, I'm expressing what I want to express, you know. The authenticity of the avatar is the person's reflection in that game. Just Google the evil. I love that concept for everyone to have. Everyone must use that. You like something, you keep something. Use it or inspect the license.

(06:51) Open access. got open here uh you go you get there they use it uh if you use the service you respect the service you know you become you have to respect it you know that's license um uh there you go to um engine uh i'm thinking of a neurodivergent first license which is what i'm saying if i use it i respect it you know it doesn't matter what it is uh it's just an open source license i made under like uh it's not gpl um but i think gpl is good for gaming i can't think about that um So the thing about this is you have to ensure that the system is fast and efficient. But you know, I'm thinking of the best kind of people that can play the game. I'm thinking of the best kind of gamers but with no money. You know, no money like me to buy a console. Basically, I bought a console, my mom bought a console, a PS3, but it never got easier.

(07:56) issues but you know the thing about the console was I was a very good player but I couldn't get the money to buy the controllers everything to use it efficiently like for example I had to I had to get when I got a ps5 my brother wanted to use it and I wanted to use it too and we had to do different things and my brother came and use it because my mom dominated me because it was my problem the problem you know those kind of problems I have to solve that problem you know I think the problem with the promotion is that you know the console is like my property my brother and sister share it you know Because I accelerated my birthday in foster care. Where was I? In foster care, in somewhere, in something called CONTACT. CONTACT is like a social contact with my mom and dad because they're in foster care. But I don't know where that place is. But the good thing about fandom is it ensures that You have to ensure authenticity.

(08:44) So basically you've got a fandom of dogs, a fandom of blocks, avatar, and you've got rivalries. Of course you've got people that don't believe in any of these things. But the thing is to ensure that everyone is treated with equity. If you're an avatar social, it's not rude to write an avatar block. I can write an avatar block. I don't even have to keep my identity. But you've got to teach and learn from each other at the bare minimum. something from it you know for opening a fandom and then trying to grow your fan fiction for example if you didn't like basically you can basically if someone wants to build an ecosystem they don't have to they don't have to like hack it they can get royalties and royalties like a system where they get royalties and they can use the system properly and the way it is like you know Basically, if I'm playing a game with my friend, the royalty acts like a, you know, I can pay my royalties, but I don't pay my royalties, you know?

(09:44) So basically, what is royalty here? Basically, I have a fanfiction, so all of this is non-narrative. So we've got a story, beginning, you know, let's say Tekken 7, which I loved. Now, I can, if I, you know, Tekken, but I want to make my own fanfiction for Tekken, you know, I don't have to bring the software to use it. I get a royalty to, you know, I get, you know, I am equitable, I use the service accordingly, I'm part of the tech community, I'm part of the system of tech, and I'm part of the fiction or fan fiction of tech. The realty allows me to develop my own ending or story to that ending, and then people can then buy that ending. But that's really cool, to have a diverse of stories, alignment, it's like Mortal Kombat, So the character ending for your story is based on how well you have followed the procedure. I'm not talking about complying, but complying in a legal way, you know, trying to do it yourself, you know, DIY policy.

(10:45) So basically, you can start with, basically, when you get a house floor, you have a family exchange, basically, all the stories are the same. That's the spirit of good and evil that connects. So basically, anyone that has a bias or doesn't really matter, as long as they can prove that the system can grow. Basically, there's one more thing I want to enforce here. So the thing about myself, I want to be active on my system, exercise is very good for me, but you can't just be pressing buttons all the time. So I'm not saying that it's bad to not play, but there's some guidelines in place for children. But what I'm saying is that This is going to be utopian. So for me, I'm thinking about it's going to be more dystopian. I'm going to be honest with you. But I'm being honest, very honest with you guys. You guys want to continue. But I'm saying to you, you've got to understand stimulus. Basically, if I'm trying to punch something, I have to see it.

(11:49) I have to observe it before I actually punch it. It doesn't happen half as fast as I am. I have to have some kind of way to spiritually connect with that thing. If it's like a timing or something, say like a combo timing.

(12:52) or like a bigotine in my hearing but those things can be intercepted the thing about this for me, you don't want to be fatigued playing games all day and fatigue just means tired, lazy, just bored just staring at the screen like a zombie so the thing about this, you have to understand that when you use it, you gotta respect it honestly I'm gonna say that again so when you use the console, you gotta respect the console because it's so powerful to you like a way to interact with your authentic self, your inner self, you know, come home, you beat someone up from work, you know, that didn't, in the game, you know, visually, you know, gave you some money to pay for your rent, you know, pay for something else, you know, coming out of food, water, shelter, the bare minimum. That's what the royalties really mean. Because, you know, if someone is talking trash and you beat them and you get your money, you know, the competition is like easy to do.

(13:24) So, you know, that's what I'm saying to you, Let them go back to their books, go back to whatever they're doing, and update their own documentation, you know, whatever it is. Games can start getting children early as possible as three, three years to start playing. Even if you're three years old, you just need parental guidance, you just play FIFA. There's no if about it, you know, there's no if about it. The thing about this effort is to ensure a system people understand the real world as it is. Whether it's an emulation simulation, you know, But the Nucleus Suite is there. It's polyglotic. You can talk to any system. Any system that's a DLL or Windows or Linux shared object or Macintosh, DILIB, Dynamic Libraries, or SLIB, or whatever. So the thing about the system is it shows the avatars.

(14:18) with us another conversation that is functional too so basically her conversation is functional so there's a dilemma if i have something nice you know it has no purpose you know that's obviously this basically i have to ensure that anything nice has um at least uh uh five percent functionality in it you can't just look like no reason it's not authentic you know if it's five percent functional you know it's not just like a feature you know you know or like uh let's just say um Let's make it 50% to 75% functional maximum. Let's say 45% functional to 60% functional. That's good enough for design, so people are not supposed to just exploit themselves and get something useless. But the thing about this is to ensure that the fandom is coherent so that people can But that's what a fandom is, it's a community of people that come together that believe
