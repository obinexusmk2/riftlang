"8070","12630"," (Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Okay guys, welcome to dimensional game theory from"
"12630","13470"," chess the Unicode."
"13810","16090"," Okay, guys, this is important to me."
"16170","17450"," I want you guys to take with almost"
"17450","17910"," dignity. "
"18470","21150"," It's not to diminish game theory that it"
"21150","21410"," is."
"21690","23910"," It's to expand the horizon of game theory"
"23910","24850"," in the real world."
"24950","27390"," You know, dimensional game theory is the real"
"27390","29090"," world's game theory, you know. "
"29390","31390"," And it's based on dimensions, you know."
"31689","33090"," This project is to cover all you need,"
"33290","35290"," just to get started with dimensional game theory."
"35290","38270"," But it's not to dismiss game theory, and"
"38270","41030"," it's also an extension of the game theory"
"41030","42770"," framework already here. "
"42890","45510"," You know, it addresses real world problems, you"
"45510","46990"," know, real world scenarios, you know."
"47250","49850"," That's the problem that dimensions have, the power"
"49850","50510"," of the dimension."
"51090","55830"," Now, the dimension is something you define, you"
"55830","57870"," know, to address this problem, you know. "
"58330","60550"," I'm going to give the limits explanation, and"
"60550","61330"," I'm going to go through this."
"62310","65070"," Okay, so I got my, here, okay, basically"
"65070","66790"," here, I got this."
"67330","70190"," So, my pen here, red, orange, so my"
"70190","72570"," ink here, you know, my pointer. "
"72910","76830"," So, dimension, the dimension is, in naming terms,"
"76970","78850"," dimension is a problem you define for what"
"78850","80790"," you want to enforce in the game, you"
"80790","80930"," know."
"81430","82790"," It's like, you know, red team, blue team,"
"82950","85770"," what's the definition, what's the particular definition, you"
"85770","85890"," know."
"86230","88890"," In chess, you know, this attack dimension, defence"
"88890","90630"," dimension, and offence definition. "
"90630","94490"," Now, these dimensions represent problems, you know."
"94630","95750"," I want to attack, I'm going to give"
"95750","96350"," the champions to attack."
"97050","98170"," I want to set up an offence with"
"98170","98470"," a pawn. "
"99330","102510"," I want to give defence, more defence, defend."
"103170","103970"," What is the strategy?"
"105470","106890"," You know, there's got, you got a lot"
"106890","108950"," of strategies like the knight, I can't remember"
"108950","109850"," the name, the lover."
"111390","112650"," You got the rook strategies, you know, like"
"112650","113610"," other ones you can use. "
"114050","118050"," Those are fragmented, you know."
"118530","120470"," Because, you know, the attack dimension overlaps with"
"120470","121870"," the defence dimension, you know."
"122150","123990"," You don't have a perfect attack, you know. "
"124130","125690"," You have something that's attack, but it's doing"
"125690","127370"," defence at the same time, you know."
"127630","129490"," Or sometimes it's defence, or offence, doing attack,"
"129610","131350"," you know, vice versa, across all dimensions."
"133090","134810"," One dimension with a game theory, oh, that's"
"134810","136210"," what I ordered you to call it. "
"137670","138930"," I'll be sure to call it."
"139490","140130"," Okay, yes."
"140130","143670"," What dimension game theory really gives you?"
"143750","146390"," You know, in a solid framework for isolating"
"146390","148750"," those algorithms in the attack, defence, or offence,"
"149030","149630"," you know. "
"149690","152030"," I'm creating new dimensions that resolve the direct"
"152030","153430"," exactly grow up."
"154190","156350"," So, you can perform each dimension and evolve"
"156350","158610"," the dimension in these threads when you use"
"158610","159830"," these animations, you know."
"160150","161790"," That is the first foundation I want to"
"161790","162370"," give you. "
"162630","164370"," Okay, let's continue."
"165650","168010"," Content, the big idea, the big picture, you"
"168010","168490"," know."
"168490","170350"," No, the big picture of the mission game"
"170350","172410"," theory is never to the mission, because it"
"172410","173590"," gives you, you know. "
"173790","176250"," The big picture is what some, you know,"
"176390","179210"," in numerous terms, it gives you the dynamic"
"179210","181210"," strategies, you know, dynamic."
"181650","183710"," The real world is dynamic, you know, model"
"183710","184430"," that, you know."
"184570","186910"," It's model real world systems, you know, real"
"186910","189870"," world games, you know, as dimensions. "
"190270","192310"," These are called dynamic algorithms, you know."
"192530","193630"," Or I'll call them a lot of original"
"193630","194510"," algorithms, you know."
"194510","196890"," Because they evolve with human cognition, you know,"
"196890","198630"," you know, and consciousness, you know, new human"
"198630","199370"," position, you know. "
"199530","202250"," I call them evolution strategies, you know."
"202410","205650"," These strategies evolve based on the information, you"
"205650","207610"," know, who will learn the enemy loop or"
"207610","208510"," what's something, you know."
"208770","212170"," It's about ensuring that, you know, the system"
"212170","215690"," actually has a goal, you know. "
"215950","219750"," And that goal is based on dynamic adaptation"
"219750","221830"," in real world context, you know."
"221830","224910"," It allows for you to be authentic in"
"224910","226930"," expression of game theory."
"227350","229610"," Of game theory without being bogged down with"
"229610","234070"," static linear systems, you know, that grow out"
"234070","236990"," of linear bound complexities. "
"238830","239210"," Let's continue."
"239870","241690"," Now, let's check the structure, you know."
"241870","242470"," Go look at the big picture. "
"242650","243890"," No, this is going to use dead projection"
"243890","245030"," against UK security."
"245470","247250"," Advancement, algorithm call and the robot applications."
"247390","248170"," Okay, guys, let's go. "
"249410","250210"," System integration."
"250810","252970"," And take away the context."
"254910","256370"," Okay, part one, the big idea. "
"258350","260029"," Dimension of game theory, the size of perfect"
"260029","260450"," strategy."
"261870","264650"," From chest algorithms to hacking Unicode, a framework"
"264650","266070"," for competition, you know."
"266590","267050"," Okay, basically. "
"267610","269790"," Basically, this one's saying to you."
"270050","272230"," The chest algorithm and Unicode hacking are the"
"272230","272770"," same, you know."
"273090","275390"," This competition, red-boom to business matter and"
"275390","276510"," the rule of thumb, you know, you're going"
"276510","277030"," to have enemies. "
"277190","279390"," You're going to have people want to infer"
"279390","279990"," to your systems."
"279990","281750"," You know, you can model them."
"281890","282870"," You can model a parallel algorithm in one"
"282870","283230"," dimension. "
"284190","284850"," But you're going to grow."
"284870","285930"," You're going to grow in a competitive balance,"
"286150","286610"," you know, dimensions."
"286870","287930"," You're going to neglect other dimensions. "
"288650","290230"," If you think the algorithm is perfect, you"
"290230","292550"," know, it only does one dimension, you know,"
"292850","293290"," not such an attack."
"293430","294690"," But it doesn't do the general defence."
"295130","297930"," But it's offensive ways to explain the difference. "
"298490","300710"," You know, this one, dimension of game theory,"
"300810","305410"," really has to address the balance of entropy"
"305410","306050"," in the system."
"306190","307370"," In the real world, you know, the balance"
"307370","307910"," of the system."
"307910","308370"," Okay. "
"309310","311770"," The limits of cognitive history, okay, static and"
"311770","311990"," rigid."
"312910","316810"," Realised on fixed payoff matrices and equilibrium concepts"
"316810","319210"," that struggle with dynamic real-world complexity."
"320290","321670"," You know, this is a big thing. "
"322210","323550"," Back there for the classical development."
"323910","324950"," Classical degree is too static."
"325110","325650"," It's too rigid. "
"325870","327370"," Every input has an output, you know."
"327590","328830"," But that input never evolves."
"329070","330390"," You know, my business adoption evolution. "
"332050","336150"," The fixed payoff is like, you know, basically,"
"336870","338330"," it's like, you know, if I have someone"
"338330","340890"," knowing what I'm doing in the real world,"
"341050","341970"," you know, I know what they're going to"
"341970","342310"," do, too."
"342930","345310"," So if it's a tie, if it comes"
"345310","347270"," from the equilibrium, which is like a tie,"
"347470","348790"," you know, it's a tie, you know, I"
"348790","349270"," know."
"349450","350190"," Then I start looking at my, you know,"
"350310","350730"," 60-50. "
"351290","354510"," Then I risk it or lose it all,"
"354570","354750"," you know."
"355110","357770"," Then my head, I'm thinking psychologically, I'm trying"
"357770","359190"," to risk everything, you know, because this guy"
"359190","359810"," is onto me."
"359810","361710"," And the other guy is thinking, yes, I'm"
"361710","362650"," going to risk everything, you know. "
"362850","363630"," And then it comes to tie."
"363870","366110"," Or in the other case, it comes to"
"366110","366910"," the worst one, you know."
"367130","367910"," They don't risk anything. "
"368130","369290"," And they both lose, you know."
"369550","371870"," You know, because there's no clear distinction between"
"371870","374090"," who's going to lose and not win."
"374290","375710"," Because, you know, the game is an equation"
"375710","378470"," of a tie or equilibrium anyway, you know. "
"378710","379990"," Because, you know, that's the model of the"
"379990","380550"," chess and everything."
"381090","383250"," The thing is, it fails to come, new"
"383250","383770"," parts are suitable."
"384150","386430"," Basically, there's new algorithms, new ways of doing"
"386430","387270"," stuff, you know. "
"387270","389730"," And there's many ways we can come up"
"389730","391670"," with scenarios to problem using other theories."
"392210","393470"," You know, all the scenarios, you know."
"393830","395410"," You know, they can directly do it. "
"395790","398150"," Or they can use adapted algorithms to create"
"398150","400410"," new solutions to the problem."
"400550","402790"," You know, rule complexity is a big thing."
"403530","405890"," But dimension and game theory addresses that using"
"405890","408170"," dimensional models of that strategy. "
"408870","410430"," We need a rule of three and practise."
"411430","412690"," And that seems a grounds to presume."
"413030","413650"," It's too rigid. "
"413790","414630"," It's too static, you know."
"414630","417370"," There's nothing, you know, you can predict input"
"417370","418470"," from the output, you know."
"418930","420230"," It's too mathematical. "
"420610","422190"," It's too slow."
"422370","422850"," It's not slow."
"422990","425170"," It's like, it's slow, but it's too box. "
"425610","427270"," It allows you to, the structure is too"
"427270","428010"," rigid, you know."
"428270","430830"," There's no flexibility even for the user who"
"430830","431830"," wants to stay in that framework."
"432050","434910"," Because the classical game theory does not adapt"
"434910","436870"," for their context. "
"437290","440110"," Because the inputs never are never more vectors."
"440510","441990"," They're just dimensions, no dimensions."
"442290","443230"," Just single layer dimensions. "
"443230","444270"," No, that's not a classical."
"444430","445050"," Just single layer."
"445530","446530"," Just killer dimensions. "
"447210","449230"," Only what inputs, you know."
"450570","451950"," Strategy dimensions are the axis of play."
"452890","455290"," Decomposing any gun between dependence non-overlapping axis,"
"455790","457970"," each dimension can be optimised separately while contributing"
"457970","459550"," global carrying his strategy. "
"460310","462150"," You know, basically, it's like a sound mixer."
"462410","464610"," You don't have to, you don't, you don't"
"464610","466830"," have to, you don't just have the volume."
"467230","468870"," You have the bass, treble, and mid-range,"
"469070","469210"," you know. "
"469510","470270"," This I'm saying, you know."
"470510","472830"," You have, basically, it's like a sound mixer."
"472830","475330"," This dimension represents a purpose. "
"475590","476830"," Like, you know, a master volume."
"477210","477810"," It's just for the volume."
"478150","479830"," But, you know, you can tell by the"
"479830","480490"," bass, you know. "
"480510","481170"," You can tell by treble."
"481570","482310"," You can tell by the mid-range, you"
"482310","482430"," know."
"482570","485230"," All the songs that make the sound more"
"485230","486150"," in tune with the environment. "
"486430","486550"," You know."
"487110","488390"," The thing about dimension game creating."
"488850","491370"," Once you analytically express those things as individuals,"
"491550","491830"," you know. "
"492330","493970"," As a core, as core individuals."
"494270","496110"," Like, you know, there's no, there's no thing"
"496110","497390"," about it, you know."
"497650","499550"," The game is here, strategic, you know. "
"499810","501170"," It allows for flexibility."
"501170","503450"," Because the dimensions are isolated."
"504050","504550"," They're independent. "
"505810","506290"," They're independent."
"506550","507930"," Don't develop over the axis, you know."
"508070","509410"," The dimension is like, you know. "
"509550","511130"," Attack, attack algorithm is not a defence algorithm."
"511510","513250"," Defence algorithm is not a defence algorithm."
"513870","516309"," Defence algorithm is not a, it's not a,"
"516390","518669"," it's not a, it's not a formation algorithm"
"518669","519730"," in chess, you know. "
"520270","522150"," You know, accessory, good dimension algorithms."
"522350","523650"," How to organise the best structure."
"524010","525070"," Get the perfect game. "
"525470","526650"," And not gonna overlap them."
"527630","528890"," Okay, the perfect game theory."
"529270","530650"," In the zero sum game. "
"531270","532270"," With perfect information."
"532430","533410"," If both plays are in place of more"
"533410","533730"," strategies."
"534450","535350"," You know, dimension. "
"536090","537350"," The game will result in a limited time."
"537830","537970"," You know."
"538190","539490"," That's the truth, you know. "
"539590","539790"," You know."
"540330","541110"," That's the truth, guys."
"541350","541470"," You know. "
"542090","542510"," Guys, you know."
"542570","542990"," This is no joke."
"543430","545690"," A non-lie outcome to prove a strategy"
"545690","546210"," imbalance. "
"546530","547670"," This is a signal we can exploit."
"549090","549730"," A corollary."
"549910","550210"," What's the corollary?"
"550370","551950"," A non-tie outcome is proof. "
"554870","555870"," Of structuring imbalance."
"556230","556890"," This is a signal we can exploit."
"557110","557810"," You know, that's a corollary. "
"557810","558410"," You know."
"558410","559190"," It's not an axiom."
"559230","559610"," It's like, you know. "
"559670","560030"," It's not."
"560590","561650"," It's an axiom, yes."
"562090","563870"," But it's a starting point for addressing this"
"563870","564650"," perfect game problem. "
"564750","564890"," You know."
"565130","565390"," Because, you know."
"567610","568050"," It's like. "
"568230","569630"," I mean, chess is a perfect game."
"569850","569950"," You know."
"570090","570670"," And he plays for the chess. "
"570810","571550"," And I play for the YouTube."
"572210","573990"," The game is a tie."
"574610","575050"," It's a tie. "
"575470","575590"," You know."
"575930","576070"," You know."
"576570","579010"," And the game always be a deterministic tie. "
"579810","580450"," DFA tie."
"580730","580850"," No."
"581070","581750"," Not an NFA tie. "
"582050","582310"," On a system."
"582950","583350"," Nothing there."
"583490","583590"," You know. "
"583650","584410"," I don't know NFA yet."
"586250","587750"," But it's a DFA tie."
"588110","588950"," It's just like the system. "
"589450","590450"," Understand you play perfectly."
"590790","591670"," I play for the game."
"592270","592530"," You know. "
"592590","594970"," It doesn't matter what the game was."
"595170","595310"," You know."
"595630","597690"," And that's why the perfect game theory matters. "
"598350","598450"," No."
"598610","599610"," The theorem is true."
"599790","600310"," It's a better term. "

"951830","952570"," The defence occur. "

"1562330","1565690"," is like output the blended strategic vector you"

"1568130","1570570"," the executor of the vector in the road"
