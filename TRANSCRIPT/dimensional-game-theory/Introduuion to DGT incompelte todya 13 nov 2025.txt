You my background, so I have This target expert. So
account and
Okay.
Okay, okay, guys, welcome to dimensional game theory, from chess to Unicode. Okay, guys, listen forward is very important to me. I want you guys to take you with the opportunity. It's not to diminish game theory that it says is to expand the horizon of game theory in the real world.
No game theory is the real world game theory, and it's based on dimensions. You know, this process will cover all you need just to get started with dimensional game theory. But it's not to dismiss game theory, and it's all of formalization is also an extension of the game theory framework already here, you know, he addresses real world problems in real world scenarios, you know. You know, that's a problem that dimensions have the power of the dimension. Now, the dimension is, is something you define, you know, to address this problem. You know, I'm going to give the limits explanation, and we're going to go through this.
Okay, so I got my here, okay, basically here. I got this. So my pen here, red, orange. So my urge, my ink here, no, my pointer. So dimension, the dimension is Newman, sub dimension is permanent source in the game. You know, that's like, you know, it's like, you know, Red Team, Blue Team. Most recognition, always business advantage. Yeah, in
chess, you know, there's a tech dimension, defense dimension and offense defenses. Now, these dimensions represent problems. You know, I want to attack. I'm going to move the champions to attack. I want to set up an offense with a pawn. I want to give defense more defend, defend. What is the strategy?
You know, there's got a goal of surgeries, like the night can't remember.
You got the rook surgeries, you know, like all the ones you can use, those are fragmented. They're forgetting about design, because they overlap, because, you know, the attack they mentioned overlap with the defense. Function. You know, you don't have a perfect attack. You know, you have something that's an attack, but doing defense at the same time, you know, or someone as a defense or open attack. You know, vice versa across all dimensions.
What dimension really? Game Three? Oh, that's why this is recording, officials, recording, okay, yes, what? What uh, what dimension game three really gives you, you know, the solid framework for isomorphing Those algorithms in the attack, defense or offense, and creating new dimensions that result for the direct exactly graph so can perform each dimension and evolve the dimension in new threats, new instances, new situations. You know, that's the first foundation I want to give you. Okay, let's continue content. The big idea, the big picture. Now, the big picture of the mission, game three is never to mention classic game three, you know, then big picture is give you the dynamic strategy of dynamic, dynamic, real world dynamic, you know model that model reward systems, you know, real world games. You know as dementia is called dynamic algorithms, you know, or call them alert evolutionary algorithms, because they evolve with human cognition. You know. You know unconsciousness, you know new human position, you know. I call them evolutional evolutionary strategies. These strategies evolve based on the information who will learn the enemy do, or what's something that it's about ensuring that the system has a goal, and that goal is based on dynamic adaptation in real world context.
It allows for you to be authentic in expression of a game three of game three, without being bogged down with static, linear systems you know that grow, grow or grow or grow out of linear bound complexities.
Let's continue now go to test the distortion you know. Can look at the big picture now there's going to use debt to against UK security advancement algorithm core and the robot applications. Okay, guys, let's go system integration and take out, take away your clothes, contents this first contest. Okay, part one, the big idea, dimension the game three, the size of perfect strategy from chess to algorithms to hacking. Unicode a framework for competition, you know, okay, basically, basically this, I'm saying to you, the chess algorithm and Unicode hacking are the same, you know, this competition red.it, doesn't matter in the rule of such you know, you have enemies. Gonna have people wanna infer to your systems. You can model the one dimension, but you can grow in aggressive device dimensions. Gonna you can neglect other dimensions. We think an atom is perfect. It only does one dimension. You know, defense was offensive. Ways to split your defense. You know, this whole dimension, game three really has to address the balance of entropy in the system. In the rural system, the use of character widget relies on fixed payoff matrices and equilibrium concepts that struggle with Dynamics, rural complexity. This is a big thing about it for the classical digital is too static. It's too rigid. Every input has an output, but that input never evolves. You know, my business adoption evolution, the
fixed payoff is like, you know, you know, basically it's like, you know, if I have someone knowing what I'm doing in rural, you know, I know what they're gonna do, too. So if it's a tie, if it's comfortable, equilibrium, it's like a tie, you know, it's a tie, you know, I I know. Then I spoke on my 5050, then I said, I said, I risk it or lose it, or, you know, then my head, I'm thinking, psychologically, I'm sure I risk everything, you know, because this guy is onto me and other guys thinking, Yes, I'm gonna risk everything, and then it comes a tie. Or on other kids, it comes to the worst one, you know, they don't risk anything, and they brought loose, because there's no clear distinction between who's gonna do, who's gonna win, because, you know, the game is a tie, or the program anyway, you know, because, you know, that's the model of the chess anything. The thing is new paths are feasible. Suitable. Basically, there's new algorithms, new ways of doing stuff, you know, you know. And there's many ways you can come up with scenarios to problem using other theories, you know, other scenarios, you know, you know, they can actually do it, or they can use adaptive algorithms to create new solutions to the problem. Rural complexity is a big thing, but the mission of game three addresses that using dimensional models of that strategy, we need a real three and practice. And that seems a branch. It's too rigid. It's too static. You know, there's nothing you know you can, you can predict input from the output. You know, it's it's too mathematical. It's too it's too slow. It's not slow. It's like this low, but it's too it's too box allows you to the structure is too rigid. You know, there's no snow flexible, even for the user wants to scale that framework, because the classical game theory does not adapt for the for their better context, because the input never are never more vectors. They just dimensions, no dimensions, just single layer dimensions. That's good. Just single layer dimensions, only what inputs?
Strategy. Dimensions as an axis of play, the composition NGO is independent, non overlapping access. Each dimension can be optimized separately while contributing global kerane strategy. Basically, it's like a sound mix that you don't have to. You don't think you don't have to. You don't just have the volume. You have the base trouble, a mid range, you know, this I'm saying you have basically use, like a sound mixer. This dimension represents purpose. Like, you know, a master volume is just for the volume. We know. You can tell the bass, you know, can table trouble, interpret the mid range. You know, all the songs that make the sound more in tune with your environment, you know the thing about dimension, once you analytically express those things as individuals, you know, as as a core, as core individuals like, you know, there's no there's no thing about it. You know, the game is here. Strategic, you know, allows for flexibility because the dimension are isolated, the independent the independent donor, level up over the axis, you know, the dimensional actors like, you know, Attack Attack algorithms, no. Defense algorithm, defense algorithm, offense algorithms, not it's not a, it's not a, it's not a. Formation algorithm in chess, you know, you know, assessor, good dimension algorithms, how to organize the best structure to get the perfect game and not want to overlap them.
Okay, the perfect game theorem, if zero sum game with perfect information, if both players and place optimal strategies in non relevant dimension, the game will result in society. You know, that's that's the truth. You know, you know, that's the truth, guys, you know. Yes, you know. This is no joke. A non lie, outcome to proof of strategy imbalance. This is signal we can exploit a coloring, a non tie. Outcome is proof
of structure imbalance. This is signal, you know, that's a coloring. You know, it's not actually, it's
an axiom, yes, finding points for this in this in this perfect game problem, you know, because you know, if
any interesting game, you know, and he plays chess, and I can relate to you, too, the game is a tie. It's a tie, you know. You know, the game always be a deterministic tie, DFA, no, not an NFA time, unless there's some nothing there, you know, I don't want FA yet. What's the DFA type? It's just a pretty
system. Understands you play perfectly. I prefer the game, you know. It doesn't matter what the start what game was, you know, and that's why the perfect game theory matters. Now, the theorem is true. It's better term is true. You know, it applies to all games in dimensions. You know where we
do. But the color is, if we have a strategic imbalance in any of those dimension, I play more than attack. You put less. Basically, if I play a perfect defense and then he keeps he plays the worst defense. No, not so perfect defense. No, I
have, I can calculate with my attacks the different balance in the defense structure of his own, or vice versa? Yeah, it doesn't matter. This I'm saying to you, okay, DAG, so basically directed exactly a graph of this chart. Yeah, there's no overlap. Now the director assignment graph is a structure of backbone in short dimension, competition and independent approach, logically preserving of a raw study Colliers, you know, basically the DAG framework is like, you know, and can trust, you can do the cost function Hamiltonian, or their own cost function, Dag based on real world estimate. But, you know, to get to the goal, you know, you know, it's like something in robot is like trying to, yes, objective, done, you know, in time. But the time is not the goal.
It's not like a traffic but you have to take the, take the road, BC, example, and then go down. Says, like, G, I can go like, basically, this star can't go there, but he has to go the other way. So it means the cost of this road, no, and that road in the river preserves the logic A to D, basically,
you know, but you know. But this is imbalance. You have to go a goal here. This depends whatever is shorter for it, or the shutter up isn't the traffic cause the jam what it knows about the state. You know, that's why the dark actually is very important. There's no overlap. Never open up in a dark structure, because, you know, it's not equivalent that unless the system doesn't allow to allow for the path to go, you know, the darkest edges that represent the cost of the knowledge. It can basically make a cost to get A to B, A to D, but you know, if the goal, if there's any deterrence, we should watch this measurement of the taxation for dimensional game to employ new strategies, you go from E to E, or whatever is available in that dimension as an optimal log n space, the community branch is log n. It's half time. Space is like the store, the space of the storage. No, it doesn't nothing. Just pause the algorithm. It's log n, you know, spaces, which is like, you know, function of the log n is harder time. It's never linear. So you can cut the problem, any problem, in half. And this one claiming here, because the dimension game three is independent of the independent but first logically, we are the directors algorithm, resolution, check, defense
and offense algorithm, or for me, be a new formation
system.
It
okay. So guys, so basically, you guys, I didn't want you guys here. So if you don't say about formation, who can information dimension, yeah, that can raise your chest formation or something, or car on the formation breaks. You know, the permission break down. They have to get someone else. Is a new ear system, a new car to join affirmation, you know, and that information has to realign with objective. You know that formation is now the chest over the car is doing. You know, your chest are calling on getting to the objective that's to go to ensure there's no delay. You know something about a cost function, or the dagger of the rough, you know, because you know the piece of the car is not missing, but someone doesn't need is scalable. Dimension is naturally scalable in the real world. You know, this is time I need is scalable. Can scale it isomorphically With a peer to peer bar, string topology, which are forthright models of topology, structure for real world, context, dimension, agreement, to represent, to me,
the rural applications of competition, in the system that resolve autonomously without any humans don't because, you know, if I order an Uber, and Uber is a robot, I should get that Uber, you know, if I have a premier member, you know. But, you know, Premier member and I still need an Uber, you know, I still need. And if you get an autonomous Uber, and get that Uber stuck, because all the stuff, they are like this, you know,
problem, you know, because I'm entitled to that service, you know. You know, I can get that car and I can go, you know, that's going to cost function. And the direct psychographic decision for the real world cost function metric to ensure 95.4 a coherent over function composition, which is the cars moving in the real world, over our terrains and places to go. Okay?
NSA, function, model, plays, a model. NFA, nothing,
basically, plays are models are notified actors. That means you have breached your act on a decision. You know, whether they see exploit or something in the real world, they are actors. You know, that means they can act. They're not just not human finals. You know. They can be. You know they can be. But the the actor models, like, you know, you have an insight in something, I can still win it, you know, you know, you know. But you know, it's like a plainer dimension. I can say it's an NFA revolution, you know. But the thing about NFA is like, is there, you know, but you know, my state action allows algebraic composition models.
Basically the actual model is more of you acting on your own behalf, on your code, you know, autonomously, your autonomous, and you're an NFA. It reminds me of delay, deny and defer. The defer is one dimension to deny or deny, to write housing so I can get the nine housing and deferral is go somewhere else and deny. It goes, go the defense record. We didn't do anything. It's not affords you. Didn't sign up. You know,
that's algorithm. Now, the NFA resolution is key to this. Because, you know that's true, and it's true. You know, if I ever I said they go somewhere else, defer me. I will lose my housing. And if I defend their business, and I say no to me, you can't refresh my foot, I'll lose my housing to delay is blaming waste time, go somewhere else. Deny, deny fault. You know delay. You know this is what algorithms, you know, delay, stop, which time deny. Say, No, no, it's not a job. It's not a quality. Defer, go somewhere else,
see the entity function to resolve this dag function, you know, because sometimes I'm up in a function. So if I want to delay some defer someone, or deny someone, or deny someone, which is illegal treatment, I have to say, Okay, after making it, then understand that solution or making picking them. But you know, you have to sound coherent to be coherent and to work. You know, that makes sense, and that's the function of mapping of functional model coming which they act on their own behalf. Now centers over structure. You know, basically the structure of the system. It's like the it's like how the system understands itself. You know, the structure over the syntax, the core measures better structure of success, rules. You know, the symptoms are just rules. You know, the code is just, you know. But you know, if the structure of that system is based on the syntax, is not a structure, because the structure is the architecture is built on. But if that syntax doesn't align with the architecture, there's no there's no meaning gonna get them to do any extra so you build first structure you're building, the architect the infrastructure you're building. Before you jump into the code, you know the perfect game. Algorithm emerges. Awareness, structure reflects through understanding. You know, guys structure, structure is more important than fintechs. You know, no matter you think about it, the structure of this structure, you know, or the model or something you're building, you know, how you model the real world incident, you know the how much clarity you have in that model as a foundation of that system. It's over the structure of the syntax, over the analytical framework. It's more beneficial because it's like, it's like security. It's like my housing thing security by design, you know, it can design the perfect wing topology and the compound, you know, and live in a moat. No one will go to a moat, you know, because you're the shark. And then you can get your mouth. You know. The structure of your mouth in the compound allows you to get in and get out of your home, you know. But the structure of the topology system is that you know that you have, you know how to get to your house, you know, as a security measure, but they can't get in because the structure of perfect security, of like, you know, the perfect algorithm, it's like designing the analysis you have to be, to be naturally hostile to anybody's intruders, you know, without because, you know, it's not trying to get your house or something like that, to get to Your properties, but it's not feasible. It's insane.
It's not easy to do. It feasible, it's not easy to do. Part ends physics construction the perfect chess engine.
Okay, now dimensional game theory decomposes chess into four overlays of contents. You know, each applicant for victual ability, semantic resolution, the attack dimension, capturing threats, King pressure, protector, morphetts, these are the attacks on how to get capture, the defense, protecting kings, pawns, structure, escape routes, and then offense, spacing, peace, activity, initiative. This obviously is more analytical, but you can use the offense to your advantage, you know, but you know the oldest at lettuce you just have to do to solve the problem for me, condition, harmony, coherence and mobile pattern, mobility pattern information, like you know, showing that some that you know you risk your pawn you know something you make a make, you make a huge bonus, not on the full, full look, or something or something that can the bishop, or something like this queen, or something that's the knight, something that can be used in another context. You know you encourage, like some defensive attack, all you want, but when you lack in any of the other things you know, there's no there's an imbalance, imbalance, the system will fail ultimately, because you neglect all the other ones. You know, think strategically. And can you add another dimension if you want? You know, the dinner exactly, the only actually this dimension. They never overlap. They never overlap. Can increase your dimension, or whether you're modeling us, but you never overlap. Okay, attack and defense, the core tactics. Now attacking a defense, fa function, a functor, a functor, D. Now this is f, the defense defense works.
You know, analyze speech, threats, compute King pressure, identify tactic motif. You know, the motto is like the payoff of like the what enemy should do. But I'm gonna play that check can be attacked here, but this like algorithm can be can be here, yeah, because these are like this functions you pull, you know, you can add impacts, which is a positive thing, but the organizer, analyze piece projection, evaluate the key safety, assess post structure. You know, these are dimensions, different definitions, the four different these are such models, the different sets, you know, the they're not union set. Can unify
or keep the dimensions isomorphic to themselves. These are problems you solve in one dimension another. You don't need to fragment the system. There's no fragmentation whatsoever. You know, the offense versus formation. Now, offense is about long term pressure, space, control, peace, activity. It's about slowing the enemy down, you know, slowing your defense down, or slowing whatever pizza. Offense is more for education. It's about the slowness of the system, trying to control this design of what's happening on a board. But you know, it's invisible. It's like, damn. It's like, you know before you know it. You lose, you lose a piece.
It's about picking the right side and ensuring long term sustainability of your system. Function is the homing. It's like, you know, condition is looking at this like a
pawn. This function is not good. That means no good, because, you know, there's a strike imbalance, don't, I couldn't keep my information thanks to information, didn't allow me to do my strategy. You know, you know, do I'm going to do with my information, because the information is intact, you know, the post can be lost, or I control the pawns, or the pawns all the other little pieces, and keep all the big pieces in the game as a perfect formation, which can do the perfect information. I resolve that, and then the offense is like the space control, making the enemy weak, weak, weak, you know, and making example of the pieces they move, and he's pushing them psychologically, you know, you know, red, blue plays basically this, like, no, no, no.
This is a change in the PR probability of photoplays is 0.6 between addition implant vector, you know, distance. You know, seven minus 0.71 is 0.6 you know, the largest property of attack dimension, significant advantage in red, you know, you know, because you know, these dimensions represent attack, defense, offense and
information scale, you know, and show that you know this really is coherent and can be reused. You know, it's a perfect strategy, because the surgery, even the mother affected in the real world, you know. And you know that means the beauty which are playing too defensively, are prone to losing the game ultimately, you know, and the lost, you know, even before the game started, because the analytic frame for defensively model over the version for any attack aggression is, is, is imbalancing in the metric, you know, One to one here represents Yes, basically 0.7 or 0.1 represent attack. 0.2 represent defense.
Six, 0.2 in red, probability of 0.6 in blue represents so basically 0.7 minus zero point of minus 0.1 is 0.6 and this 0.6 is P r minus P B, and this is property of the red over blue. Attack versus defense is more over the dimensions attack, defense, offense and formation. You know, these are just four dimensions that I also made dimensions, but they're not modeling the problem.
Balance vector.
This vector,
change, the change in change in you, change in probability of R can be measured in row, time, therefore, in the runtime in the robot, you know, it's a metric for defense, coherence, how good your your dimensions are doing. How good you are,
detect, identify the strongest dimension, neutralize a tiny negative. Way to counter it, we direct shift focus to adjacent dimensions. Output, the bending strategy vector, you know, you know, some fancy So, basically, so basically you it's like, you know, robot you live in, you know. So basically you're doing soon enough, finishing mention, that's your worst case scenario. You don't want that thing getting involved in
neutralize the weight, negative weights to counter it, you know. So basically, now there's a more balance for you.
That's the Queen redirect. You switch, like this dimension, dimension. And that's like the worst, next worst problem. You got to do it. And the next one is like a output, the blended strategic vector, you know. Now, the blended strategy vector is like the execution of the vector in the road, but you know, it's like, Please give one, detect two, new trace, three reduction, and then that new function, you put a new dimension there, and gives a new probability score. And that imbalance has been remeasured, you know. And that's after that's one in question taking place. You know, that's why real time, because you execute ain't going in dimension. But I mean dimension means that this variable, I'm looking at the same thing, but in different contexts, you know, I have different objective, you know. You know, using this same team, that's imbalance is measuring and real time, okay? Now, Unicode security, three.
Now, case study apply security, the problem is multi encoding by persuasion files. You know, direct encoded, basically the encoded format the document. You know, if I type this on a terminal, this encoder format. Now the user reputation is problematic because, you know, these are, these are these are traditional bypass filters. You know this, I can use this structural, sensitive project, the problem multiple path encoding of the same attack vector, bypass ratio filters. So this, I can put in this UTF eight model of the synchronous state. And this will be, I can, I can encode this in UTF eight, you know, you know. But this was encoded in this computer. This is direct one. This one's going through the computer every
character, but this YouTube for realization, you know, you know. Now this, yes, you know, it's, you know, because YouTube is non canonical, you know, this extra factor the same message. I can punch the same, you know, or write a complete program, and I can bypass the root access. But you know, if that is current director or That's dot.is, like this one, but this YouTube is the system doesn't understand the doesn't don't take this input. It takes this input because this is the encoding of the UTF eight system, which stands for unified Unicode. Unicode format of eight bytes of memory, eight bytes, a basic to one byte model with code UTF eight, because it cost eight times eight. It goes 64 bytes. I think, yes, I believe so. I suppose so. Basically, state different encoder just pop. Different encoders are just different parts to somatic states, collapsing into still, color form. The canonical form is the simplest model that's used for the standard application of robot systems. You know, kind of code just means universal, you know, this is the simplest form of the universal framework. You know, the canonical form is, it's like, it's like, you know, ensuring that bugs a small reduction off state is chemical is a feature. It's a bug. It's a feature. It's not about to reduce all the auto code, all in calling, you know, ensure that you cannot, you cannot route out of your stream of rats with any interface system provided by the user or the hacker. State, you know the fly here a timer, stop, stop, fly, me, fly.
So basically, state, psi, Flash, time. I'm saying using us in UNC algorithm, a three phase recognition. Classical inputs are by encoding side two map or the equivalent splitting chemical form three apply for a single, unified security policy. The thing about this is like the recognition of the UCN Unicode skeleton characterization or normalization. Normalization means like the smallest form. So chemical is the simplest one, normal second, one system and b1 system. But normalized form is chemical form two and then this Unicode structure, kind of code normalization algorithms, a three phase pipeline, the result of this one localization, critical inputs by encoding type, and then a two reduction map or form, and then three, validate a single, uniform security policy as part of the magical engineering principle as a protocol of the system that's log n now learning, because you know, if you have a n in A so can have something login, but if They log in, finish file goes faster and validation is validation is first. You know, before the linear time algorithm, there's no need to validate, because, you know the good time algorithm. I'll take some more time than the login because you don't have results of encoding based bypass, which is a better reduction in passing time. You know, your computers need to pass nothing. You know, if you run the code, you know, that's the idea of UNC, algorithm three, pipeline, okay, now us you you see USN production methods, now, processing time sevenDimenstion game Thoery
