00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,630
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Okay guys, welcome to dimensional game theory from

2
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,470
chess the Unicode.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,090
Okay, guys, this is important to me.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,450
I want you guys to take with almost

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:17,910
dignity.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,150
It's not to diminish game theory that it

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,410
is.

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,910
It's to expand the horizon of game theory

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:24,850
in the real world.

10
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,390
You know, dimensional game theory is the real

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,090
world's game theory, you know.

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,390
And it's based on dimensions, you know.

13
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,090
This project is to cover all you need,

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:35,290
just to get started with dimensional game theory.

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,270
But it's not to dismiss game theory, and

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,030
it's also an extension of the game theory

17
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,770
framework already here.

18
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,510
You know, it addresses real world problems, you

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,990
know, real world scenarios, you know.

20
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,850
That's the problem that dimensions have, the power

21
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,510
of the dimension.

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,830
Now, the dimension is something you define, you

23
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,870
know, to address this problem, you know.

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,550
I'm going to give the limits explanation, and

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,330
I'm going to go through this.

26
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,070
Okay, so I got my, here, okay, basically

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,790
here, I got this.

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,190
So, my pen here, red, orange, so my

29
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,570
ink here, you know, my pointer.

30
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,830
So, dimension, the dimension is, in naming terms,

31
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,850
dimension is a problem you define for what

32
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,790
you want to enforce in the game, you

33
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:20,930
know.

34
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,790
It's like, you know, red team, blue team,

35
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,770
what's the definition, what's the particular definition, you

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:25,890
know.

37
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,890
In chess, you know, this attack dimension, defence

38
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,630
dimension, and offence definition.

39
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,490
Now, these dimensions represent problems, you know.

40
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,750
I want to attack, I'm going to give

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,350
the champions to attack.

42
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,170
I want to set up an offence with

43
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,470
a pawn.

44
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,510
I want to give defence, more defence, defend.

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,970
What is the strategy?

46
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,890
You know, there's got, you got a lot

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,950
of strategies like the knight, I can't remember

48
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,850
the name, the lover.

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,650
You got the rook strategies, you know, like

50
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,610
other ones you can use.

51
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,050
Those are fragmented, you know.

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,470
Because, you know, the attack dimension overlaps with

53
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,870
the defence dimension, you know.

54
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,990
You don't have a perfect attack, you know.

55
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,690
You have something that's attack, but it's doing

56
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,370
defence at the same time, you know.

57
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,490
Or sometimes it's defence, or offence, doing attack,

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,350
you know, vice versa, across all dimensions.

59
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,810
One dimension with a game theory, oh, that's

60
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,210
what I ordered you to call it.

61
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,930
I'll be sure to call it.

62
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,130
Okay, yes.

63
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,670
What dimension game theory really gives you?

64
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,390
You know, in a solid framework for isolating

65
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,750
those algorithms in the attack, defence, or offence,

66
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,630
you know.

67
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,030
I'm creating new dimensions that resolve the direct

68
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,430
exactly grow up.

69
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,350
So, you can perform each dimension and evolve

70
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,610
the dimension in these threads when you use

71
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,830
these animations, you know.

72
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,790
That is the first foundation I want to

73
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,370
give you.

74
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,370
Okay, let's continue.

75
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,010
Content, the big idea, the big picture, you

76
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,490
know.

77
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,350
No, the big picture of the mission game

78
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,410
theory is never to the mission, because it

79
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,590
gives you, you know.

80
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,250
The big picture is what some, you know,

81
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,210
in numerous terms, it gives you the dynamic

82
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,210
strategies, you know, dynamic.

83
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,710
The real world is dynamic, you know, model

84
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,430
that, you know.

85
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,910
It's model real world systems, you know, real

86
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,870
world games, you know, as dimensions.

87
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,310
These are called dynamic algorithms, you know.

88
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,630
Or I'll call them a lot of original

89
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,510
algorithms, you know.

90
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,890
Because they evolve with human cognition, you know,

91
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,630
you know, and consciousness, you know, new human

92
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,370
position, you know.

93
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,250
I call them evolution strategies, you know.

94
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,650
These strategies evolve based on the information, you

95
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,610
know, who will learn the enemy loop or

96
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,510
what's something, you know.

97
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,170
It's about ensuring that, you know, the system

98
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,690
actually has a goal, you know.

99
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,750
And that goal is based on dynamic adaptation

100
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,830
in real world context, you know.

101
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,910
It allows for you to be authentic in

102
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,930
expression of game theory.

103
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,610
Of game theory without being bogged down with

104
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,070
static linear systems, you know, that grow out

105
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,990
of linear bound complexities.

106
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,210
Let's continue.

107
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,690
Now, let's check the structure, you know.

108
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,470
Go look at the big picture.

109
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,890
No, this is going to use dead projection

110
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,030
against UK security.

111
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,250
Advancement, algorithm call and the robot applications.

112
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,170
Okay, guys, let's go.

113
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,210
System integration.

114
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,970
And take away the context.

115
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,370
Okay, part one, the big idea.

116
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,029
Dimension of game theory, the size of perfect

117
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,450
strategy.

118
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,650
From chest algorithms to hacking Unicode, a framework

119
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,070
for competition, you know.

120
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,050
Okay, basically.

121
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,790
Basically, this one's saying to you.

122
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,230
The chest algorithm and Unicode hacking are the

123
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,770
same, you know.

124
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,390
This competition, red-boom to business matter and

125
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,510
the rule of thumb, you know, you're going

126
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,030
to have enemies.

127
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,390
You're going to have people want to infer

128
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:39,990
to your systems.

129
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,750
You know, you can model them.

130
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,870
You can model a parallel algorithm in one

131
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,230
dimension.

132
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,850
But you're going to grow.

133
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,930
You're going to grow in a competitive balance,

134
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,610
you know, dimensions.

135
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,930
You're going to neglect other dimensions.

136
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,230
If you think the algorithm is perfect, you

137
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,550
know, it only does one dimension, you know,

138
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,290
not such an attack.

139
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,690
But it doesn't do the general defence.

140
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,930
But it's offensive ways to explain the difference.

141
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,710
You know, this one, dimension of game theory,

142
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,410
really has to address the balance of entropy

143
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,050
in the system.

144
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,370
In the real world, you know, the balance

145
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:07,910
of the system.

146
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,370
Okay.

147
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,770
The limits of cognitive history, okay, static and

148
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:11,990
rigid.

149
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,810
Realised on fixed payoff matrices and equilibrium concepts

150
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,210
that struggle with dynamic real-world complexity.

151
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,670
You know, this is a big thing.

152
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,550
Back there for the classical development.

153
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,950
Classical degree is too static.

154
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,650
It's too rigid.

155
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,370
Every input has an output, you know.

156
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,830
But that input never evolves.

157
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,390
You know, my business adoption evolution.

158
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,150
The fixed payoff is like, you know, basically,

159
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,330
it's like, you know, if I have someone

160
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,890
knowing what I'm doing in the real world,

161
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,970
you know, I know what they're going to

162
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:42,310
do, too.

163
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,310
So if it's a tie, if it comes

164
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,270
from the equilibrium, which is like a tie,

165
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,790
you know, it's a tie, you know, I

166
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,270
know.

167
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,190
Then I start looking at my, you know,

168
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,730
60-50.

169
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,510
Then I risk it or lose it all,

170
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:54,750
you know.

171
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,770
Then my head, I'm thinking psychologically, I'm trying

172
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,190
to risk everything, you know, because this guy

173
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,810
is onto me.

174
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,710
And the other guy is thinking, yes, I'm

175
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,650
going to risk everything, you know.

176
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,630
And then it comes to tie.

177
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,110
Or in the other case, it comes to

178
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,910
the worst one, you know.

179
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,910
They don't risk anything.

180
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,290
And they both lose, you know.

181
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,870
You know, because there's no clear distinction between

182
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,090
who's going to lose and not win.

183
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,710
Because, you know, the game is an equation

184
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,470
of a tie or equilibrium anyway, you know.

185
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,990
Because, you know, that's the model of the

186
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,550
chess and everything.

187
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,250
The thing is, it fails to come, new

188
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,770
parts are suitable.

189
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,430
Basically, there's new algorithms, new ways of doing

190
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,270
stuff, you know.

191
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,730
And there's many ways we can come up

192
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,670
with scenarios to problem using other theories.

193
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,470
You know, all the scenarios, you know.

194
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,410
You know, they can directly do it.

195
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,150
Or they can use adapted algorithms to create

196
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,410
new solutions to the problem.

197
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,790
You know, rule complexity is a big thing.

198
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,890
But dimension and game theory addresses that using

199
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,170
dimensional models of that strategy.

200
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,430
We need a rule of three and practise.

201
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,690
And that seems a grounds to presume.

202
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,650
It's too rigid.

203
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,630
It's too static, you know.

204
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,370
There's nothing, you know, you can predict input

205
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,470
from the output, you know.

206
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,230
It's too mathematical.

207
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,190
It's too slow.

208
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,850
It's not slow.

209
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,170
It's like, it's slow, but it's too box.

210
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,270
It allows you to, the structure is too

211
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,010
rigid, you know.

212
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,830
There's no flexibility even for the user who

213
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,830
wants to stay in that framework.

214
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,910
Because the classical game theory does not adapt

215
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,870
for their context.

216
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,110
Because the inputs never are never more vectors.

217
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,990
They're just dimensions, no dimensions.

218
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,230
Just single layer dimensions.

219
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,270
No, that's not a classical.

220
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,050
Just single layer.

221
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,530
Just killer dimensions.

222
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,230
Only what inputs, you know.

223
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,950
Strategy dimensions are the axis of play.

224
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,290
Decomposing any gun between dependence non-overlapping axis,

225
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,970
each dimension can be optimised separately while contributing

226
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,550
global carrying his strategy.

227
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,150
You know, basically, it's like a sound mixer.

228
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,610
You don't have to, you don't, you don't

229
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,830
have to, you don't just have the volume.

230
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,870
You have the bass, treble, and mid-range,

231
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,210
you know.

232
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,270
This I'm saying, you know.

233
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,830
You have, basically, it's like a sound mixer.

234
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,330
This dimension represents a purpose.

235
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,830
Like, you know, a master volume.

236
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:57,810
It's just for the volume.

237
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,830
But, you know, you can tell by the

238
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,490
bass, you know.

239
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,170
You can tell by treble.

240
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,310
You can tell by the mid-range, you

241
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,430
know.

242
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,230
All the songs that make the sound more

243
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,150
in tune with the environment.

244
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:06,550
You know.

245
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,390
The thing about dimension game creating.

246
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,370
Once you analytically express those things as individuals,

247
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:11,830
you know.

248
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,970
As a core, as core individuals.

249
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,110
Like, you know, there's no, there's no thing

250
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,390
about it, you know.

251
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,550
The game is here, strategic, you know.

252
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,170
It allows for flexibility.

253
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,450
Because the dimensions are isolated.

254
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,550
They're independent.

255
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,290
They're independent.

256
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,930
Don't develop over the axis, you know.

257
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,410
The dimension is like, you know.

258
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,130
Attack, attack algorithm is not a defence algorithm.

259
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,250
Defence algorithm is not a defence algorithm.

260
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,309
Defence algorithm is not a, it's not a,

261
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,669
it's not a, it's not a formation algorithm

262
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,730
in chess, you know.

263
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,150
You know, accessory, good dimension algorithms.

264
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,650
How to organise the best structure.

265
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,070
Get the perfect game.

266
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,650
And not gonna overlap them.

267
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,890
Okay, the perfect game theory.

268
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,650
In the zero sum game.

269
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,270
With perfect information.

270
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,410
If both plays are in place of more

271
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:53,730
strategies.

272
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,350
You know, dimension.

273
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,350
The game will result in a limited time.

274
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:57,970
You know.

275
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,490
That's the truth, you know.

276
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,790
You know.

277
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,110
That's the truth, guys.

278
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,470
You know.

279
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,510
Guys, you know.

280
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:02,990
This is no joke.

281
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,690
A non-lie outcome to prove a strategy

282
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,210
imbalance.

283
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,670
This is a signal we can exploit.

284
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,730
A corollary.

285
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,210
What's the corollary?

286
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,950
A non-tie outcome is proof.

287
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,870
Of structuring imbalance.

288
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,890
This is a signal we can exploit.

289
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,810
You know, that's a corollary.

290
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:18,410
You know.

291
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,190
It's not an axiom.

292
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:19,610
It's like, you know.

293
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,030
It's not.

294
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,650
It's an axiom, yes.

295
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,870
But it's a starting point for addressing this

296
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,650
perfect game problem.

297
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:24,890
You know.

298
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,390
Because, you know.

299
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,050
It's like.

300
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,630
I mean, chess is a perfect game.

301
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:29,950
You know.

302
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,670
And he plays for the chess.

303
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,550
And I play for the YouTube.

304
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,990
The game is a tie.

305
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,050
It's a tie.

306
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:35,590
You know.

307
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,070
You know.

308
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,010
And the game always be a deterministic tie.

309
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,450
DFA tie.

310
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:40,850
No.

311
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:41,750
Not an NFA tie.

312
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,310
On a system.

313
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,350
Nothing there.

314
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:43,590
You know.

315
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,410
I don't know NFA yet.

316
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,750
But it's a DFA tie.

317
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,950
It's just like the system.

318
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,450
Understand you play perfectly.

319
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,670
I play for the game.

320
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:52,530
You know.

321
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,970
It doesn't matter what the game was.

322
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,310
You know.

323
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,690
And that's why the perfect game theory matters.

324
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,450
No.

325
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,610
The theorem is true.

326
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,310
It's a better term.

327
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,630
It's true.

328
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:00,890
You know.

329
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,870
It applies to all games.

330
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,730
In the end dimensions.

331
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,030
You know.

332
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,490
Where we do.

333
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,170
But the corollary is.

334
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,770
If we have a strategic imbalance.

335
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,030
In any other dimension.

336
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,270
I play more than attack.

337
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,050
He plays less.

338
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,110
Basically.

339
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,550
If I play a perfect defence.

340
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,610
And then he keeps.

341
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,390
He plays a wide range.

342
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,110
No.

343
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,310
Not so perfect defence.

344
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,570
You know.

345
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,710
I have.

346
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,250
I can couple this with my attacks.

347
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,070
The balance.

348
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,270
In the defence.

349
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,350
Structure of his.

350
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,530
Or vice versa.

351
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:25,530
You know.

352
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,210
It doesn't matter.

353
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,470
This one is saying to you.

354
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,290
DAG.

355
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,030
So basically.

356
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,150
Directed exactly.

357
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,530
A graph of this chart.

358
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:32,890
You know.

359
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,690
There's no overlap.

360
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:34,270
Now.

361
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,330
Directed aside graph.

362
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,650
It's a structural backbone.

363
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,350
You shoot the winning competition.

364
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,830
And independent applause logically.

365
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:40,670
Preserving.

366
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:41,390
Other.

367
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,730
Overall strategic clearance.

368
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:43,330
You know.

369
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,090
Basically.

370
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,730
The DAG framework.

371
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,430
It's like you know.

372
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,730
And.

373
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,230
Can you trust.

374
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,590
Do the cost function.

375
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,130
Hamiltonian.

376
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,550
Or Larian.

377
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,950
Cost function DAG.

378
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,310
Based on real world estimate.

379
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,530
But you know.

380
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,270
To get to the goal.

381
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:55,770
You know.

382
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,170
You know.

383
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:56,850
It's like.

384
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,250
It's like something in the real world.

385
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,630
It's like.

386
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,370
Trying to.

387
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:00,770
Yes.

388
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,170
It's actually.

389
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,310
Again it's objective.

390
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:02,910
Done.

391
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,290
You know.

392
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:03,670
In time.

393
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,430
But the time.

394
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,010
It's not the goal.

395
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,250
It's time.

396
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:07,890
It's not the goal.

397
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,390
It's like a traffic.

398
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,030
You know.

399
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,570
But you have to.

400
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,330
Check the.

401
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,130
Check the road.

402
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:12,830
B C.

403
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,370
For example.

404
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,650
And then go down.

405
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,310
Say it's like G.

406
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,350
Because I can go like.

407
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,510
Basically I'm going to A to D.

408
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,430
Basically this car.

409
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,350
Can't go there.

410
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:22,950
A to D.

411
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,070
But it has to go all the way.

412
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,390
You know.

413
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,050
So it has to.

414
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,470
Excuse me.

415
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,370
The cost of this road.

416
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:26,870
You know.

417
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,290
And that road in the real world.

418
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:28,970
Preserves the logic.

419
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:29,830
A to D.

420
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,170
It's going to.

421
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,410
It goes A to D.

422
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:33,830
You know.

423
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,630
But you know.

424
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,150
But this is an imbalance.

425
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,050
It has to go.

426
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,590
You can go A.

427
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,430
You can go A here.

428
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:40,910
Just depends.

429
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,010
Whatever is shorter for it.

430
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,430
What is shorter?

431
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:42,870
What is missing?

432
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,070
The traffic cost.

433
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:44,810
The jam.

434
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,050
What it knows about the state.

435
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,370
You know.

436
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,770
Can't spot a dark access ramp.

437
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,670
There's no overlap.

438
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:49,110
You know.

439
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,010
This should never open up in a dark

440
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,210
structure.

441
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:51,670
You know.

442
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,010
Because you know.

443
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,570
It's not going from a dark area.

444
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:54,350
Unless the system.

445
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,230
Doesn't allow.

446
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,670
Doesn't allow for the path to go.

447
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:57,150
You know.

448
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,430
The time that the edges.

449
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,230
Can represent.

450
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,730
The cost of the.

451
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,090
It can basically make a cost to get

452
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,730
A to B.

453
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,150
You know.

454
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,510
A to D.

455
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,410
But you know.

456
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,010
If the goal.

457
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,210
If there's any determinants.

458
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,150
Which is worst case measurement.

459
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:09,930
Of the dark structure.

460
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,070
For the dimension of the game.

461
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,370
So I'm putting new strategies.

462
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,690
You go from E to E.

463
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,090
Or whatever is available in that dimension.

464
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:16,910
You know.

465
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,430
As an optimal log n space.

466
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,410
You know.

467
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,850
The computer is log n.

468
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,870
It's half time.

469
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:23,930
Space.

470
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,190
Because the space is like the storage.

471
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,190
Space of the storage.

472
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,530
You know.

473
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,050
It doesn't have to think.

474
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,950
It just stores the algorithm.

475
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,530
It's log n.

476
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:30,930
You know.

477
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,530
It's actually spaced.

478
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,970
It's like you know.

479
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,650
The front equation.

480
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,430
Of the log n.

481
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,030
It's half the time.

482
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:35,550
It's never linear.

483
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,530
So you can count the problem.

484
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,410
Any problem in half.

485
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,530
I know some claiming here.

486
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,050
Because.

487
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,130
The dimension of game three.

488
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:40,790
Is independent.

489
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,770
Of the.

490
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,410
Of this.

491
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,390
Is independent.

492
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,370
But logically.

493
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:45,310
We are the directors.

494
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,490
Algorithm resolution.

495
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,070
You know.

496
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,770
You can just see the question.

497
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,410
Attack defence.

498
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,390
And offence algorithm.

499
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:49,870
Or for me.

500
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,210
Get a new formation system.

501
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,190
No.

502
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:53,550
No.

503
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,050
Sorry guys.

504
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,350
Sorry guys.

505
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,090
I don't know about.

506
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:57,690
Sorry guys.

507
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,150
Sorry guys.

508
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:02,930
Sorry guys.

509
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:03,870
Sorry guys.

510
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,310
I got interrupted.

511
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,070
The turn is playing.

512
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,150
Okay.

513
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,550
So guys.

514
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,210
So basically.

515
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,710
I didn't want you guys to hear that.

516
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,610
Sorry guys.

517
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,590
I didn't want you guys to hear that.

518
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,430
So Z team.

519
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,650
They don't understand about formation.

520
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,650
They don't even need formation dimension.

521
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:14,090
You know.

522
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,370
That can reject chest formation.

523
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:15,730
You know.

524
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,350
Or something.

525
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,050
Or car.

526
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,390
On the formation breaks.

527
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,030
You know.

528
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,850
The formation break down.

529
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,390
They have to get someone else.

530
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,590
There's a new ES system.

531
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,270
A new car.

532
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,010
To drain that formation.

533
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:24,690
You know.

534
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,610
And that formation has to be aligned with

535
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:26,890
objective.

536
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:27,690
You know.

537
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,370
That formation is not the chest.

538
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:30,310
All of the car is doing.

539
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:30,590
You know.

540
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,710
Your chest are calling them.

541
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,370
Getting to the objective.

542
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:32,730
You know.

543
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,470
That has to go.

544
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:33,850
You know.

545
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,210
To ensure there's no delay.

546
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:35,910
You know.

547
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,150
That's what I'm saying about the cost function.

548
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,530
The dagger of the graph.

549
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,990
You know.

550
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,430
Because you know.

551
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,790
The piece of the car.

552
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,670
It's not missing.

553
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:42,910
But someone is new.

554
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,650
Is scalable.

555
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,470
You know.

556
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,090
It's scalable.

557
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,810
You can scale it.

558
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,350
Isomorphically.

559
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:53,530
With peer to peer.

560
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,670
Bar string topology.

561
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,270
Which are four thread models.

562
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,910
Of topology structure.

563
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:58,610
You know.

564
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,450
For real world context.

565
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,010
You know.

566
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,810
Dimension of green.

567
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,610
To represent to me.

568
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,930
The real world applications.

569
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:03,870
Of computation.

570
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:04,930
In the system.

571
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,750
That resolve autonomously without any humans.

572
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:08,430
You know.

573
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,490
Because you know.

574
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,290
If I order an Uber.

575
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,710
An Uber is a robot.

576
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,530
You know.

577
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:12,930
His robot.

578
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,630
And she gets the phone.

579
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,510
You know.

580
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,130
If I have a premium member.

581
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:16,790
You know.

582
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,290
But you know.

583
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,130
If I'm not a premium member.

584
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,070
And I still need an Uber.

585
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:20,850
You know.

586
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:21,650
I still need.

587
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:22,630
I need to get an autonomous Uber.

588
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,650
And get that Uber.

589
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:23,930
Stop.

590
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:24,510
You know.

591
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,310
Because all the parameters.

592
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,770
Stop.

593
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,830
They are an additional problem.

594
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,250
You know.

595
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,850
Because I am entitled to that service.

596
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:29,330
You know.

597
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:29,630
You know.

598
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,530
I can get that car.

599
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,010
And I can go.

600
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:31,470
You know.

601
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,170
That's what I'm talking about.

602
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:32,690
The cost function.

603
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:33,670
I have the direct.

604
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,730
A sacrificial position.

605
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,130
For the real world cost function.

606
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,470
Metric.

607
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,270
To ensure that the 5.4. Coherence.

608
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,150
Over function.

609
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:40,850
Composition.

610
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:41,770
Which is the cost.

611
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,590
Moving the real world.

612
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,670
Over terrains.

613
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,530
And places to go.

614
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,370
NFA function model.

615
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,490
Place a model.

616
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:50,550
NFA.

617
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,230
Okay.

618
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:53,550
Place a model.

619
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,610
NFA function model.

620
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,390
Actors.

621
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,550
That means they have way to act on

622
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,930
a decision.

623
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:58,390
You know.

624
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,250
Whether they see.

625
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,190
Exploit or something.

626
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,290
In the real world.

627
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,090
They are actors.

628
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:02,430
You know.

629
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,410
That means they can act.

630
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,370
They not just.

631
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,250
Not so much.

632
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,150
You know.

633
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,350
They can be.

634
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:08,950
You know.

635
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,490
They can be.

636
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,150
But the.

637
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,190
The actor model.

638
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:11,650
It's like you know.

639
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,650
You don't have an insight.

640
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:13,530
In something.

641
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,510
I can still win it.

642
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,910
But you know.

643
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,130
It's like a plain dimension.

644
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,710
Like I say it's an NFA resolution.

645
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:20,430
You know.

646
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,550
But the thing about NFA is like.

647
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:23,290
It's there.

648
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,670
You know.

649
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,610
It's not going to sound like something.

650
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,350
But you know.

651
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,030
Map the function to state action.

652
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:27,470
You know.

653
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,270
The allows algebraic composition.

654
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,130
A model.

655
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,690
Basically the actor model.

656
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,130
Is more of you.

657
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,510
Acting on your own behalf.

658
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,750
On your own code.

659
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:37,050
You know.

660
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,050
Autonomously.

661
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,750
Your autonomous.

662
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,390
You know NFA.

663
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,050
You know.

664
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,170
It reminds me of delay.

665
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,070
Deny and defer.

666
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,870
The defer is one dimension.

667
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:44,830
To deny.

668
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,390
Deny to right housing.

669
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,470
So I can get denied housing.

670
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,170
And deferral is go somewhere else.

671
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,430
And deny is go.

672
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,570
The defence occur.

673
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,450
We didn't do anything.

674
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,010
It's not affords.

675
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,850
You didn't sign up.

676
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,350
You know.

677
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,370
That's algorithm.

678
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,070
Now.

679
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,990
The NFA resolution.

680
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,210
Is key to this.

681
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,510
Because you know.

682
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,950
That's to end is to it.

683
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,190
You know.

684
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,870
If I ever.

685
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,810
I said the.

686
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,770
It's actually go somewhere else.

687
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,430
Defer me.

688
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,730
I will lose my housing.

689
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,470
And if I really defend my business.

690
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,570
And I say no to them.

691
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,090
You can't.

692
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:10,670
So it's my fault.

693
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,430
I'll lose my housing.

694
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,370
And I don't think delay is.

695
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,790
Blame me.

696
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,350
Waste time.

697
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,450
Go somewhere else.

698
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,790
Deny.

699
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,410
Deny.

700
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,510
You know.

701
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,130
It's not affords.

702
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,470
You know.

703
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,390
Deny.

704
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:21,850
You know.

705
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,430
This is what algorithms you know.

706
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:23,910
Delay.

707
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,530
Stop waste time.

708
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,570
Deny.

709
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,310
Say no.

710
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:27,930
Say no.

711
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,550
It's not a job.

712
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,350
It's not a society.

713
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,670
Defer.

714
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,550
Go somewhere else.

715
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:34,990
You know.

716
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,230
I'm saying.

717
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:35,750
See.

718
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,070
The NFA function can resolve this DAG function.

719
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,370
You know.

720
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,910
Because the function is a mapping of function.

721
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,390
You know.

722
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,570
So if I want to delay some.

723
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,330
Defer someone.

724
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,190
Or deny someone.

725
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,030
Which is illegal treatment.

726
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:44,890
I have to say.

727
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,150
Okay.

728
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:45,790
I have to make it.

729
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,090
Then.

730
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,410
Understand DAGs original.

731
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,190
Making.

732
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,130
But you know.

733
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,030
You must be sound coherent.

734
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,650
To be coherent.

735
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,250
And to work.

736
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:52,710
You know.

737
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,490
That's to make sense.

738
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,490
And that's why the function.

739
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,110
Mapping a functional model coming.

740
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,790
Which can act on your own behalf.

741
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,230
Since that's our structure.

742
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,750
You know.

743
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,250
Basically.

744
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,850
The structure of the system.

745
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,950
You know.

746
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,490
It's like the.

747
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,630
It's like how the system.

748
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,270
Understands.

749
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:07,490
It's.

750
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:07,930
You know.

751
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,130
The structure.

752
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:09,730
Over the syntax.

753
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,050
You know.

754
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:10,829
The core results.

755
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,589
But the structure.

756
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,210
Of units.

757
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,910
You know.

758
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:14,550
The synthesis.

759
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,069
Just rules.

760
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:15,369
You know.

761
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,390
But you know.

762
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,690
If the structure of that system.

763
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:19,310
Is.

764
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:20,510
Based on.

765
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,829
The syntax is not a structure.

766
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,270
Because.

767
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,929
The.

768
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,530
The structure.

769
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,630
Is like the architecture built on.

770
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:27,850
But if that syntax.

771
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,570
Doesn't.

772
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,550
Allow the architecture.

773
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,310
There's no.

774
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,450
There's no meaning.

775
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,070
Can I get system to do any extra.

776
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,430
You know.

777
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:34,830
So you build first structure.

778
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,190
You're building the architecture.

779
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,510
The infrastructure you're building.

780
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,510
Before you.

781
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,670
Jump into the code.

782
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:39,950
You know.

783
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,350
The perfect game algorithm.

784
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,190
Emerges.

785
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,010
When structure reflects through understanding.

786
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,770
You know guys.

787
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,510
Structure.

788
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,050
Structure is more important than syntax.

789
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,670
You know.

790
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,730
You know.

791
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:52,870
No matter how you think about it.

792
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,250
The structure of this structure.

793
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:54,830
You know.

794
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,350
Or the model.

795
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,470
Or something you're building.

796
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,290
You know.

797
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,590
How you model the real world.

798
00:17:59,330 --> 00:17:59,550
Instance.

799
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,050
You know.

800
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,950
How much clarity you have in that model.

801
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:04,470
You know.

802
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,330
As a foundation.

803
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:05,970
You know.

804
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,430
Of that system.

805
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,590
It's over the structure.

806
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,090
Of the syntax.

807
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,790
Over the analytical framework.

808
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,450
You know.

809
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,010
It's more beneficial.

810
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,130
Because it's like.

811
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,170
It's like security.

812
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,330
It's like my housing thing.

813
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,610
Security by design.

814
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,010
You know.

815
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,010
It can design.

816
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,110
The perfect window.

817
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,330
The topology.

818
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,350
And the compound.

819
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,370
You know.

820
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,310
And even the modes.

821
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,590
No one will go to your modes.

822
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:25,990
You know.

823
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:26,330
Because you know.

824
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,270
This is the shock.

825
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,310
And then you can get your modes.

826
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:28,610
You know.

827
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,570
The structure of your modes.

828
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,670
In the compound.

829
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,210
Allows you to get in.

830
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,410
And get out of your home.

831
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,170
You know.

832
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,530
But the structure of the topology system.

833
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,310
Is that.

834
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,770
You know.

835
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,970
You know how to get to your house.

836
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,550
You know.

837
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,750
As a security measure.

838
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,710
But you can't get in.

839
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,030
Because the structure reflects.

840
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:44,670
You towards.

841
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,210
A purpose.

842
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,590
A security.

843
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,510
Of like you know.

844
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,550
The perfect algorithm.

845
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,070
You know.

846
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,410
Because you know.

847
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,670
It's like designing the houses.

848
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,310
Your house.

849
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:51,730
To be.

850
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,170
To be naturally hostile.

851
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,530
To anybody's intruders.

852
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,010
You know.

853
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:56,910
Without.

854
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:57,890
Because you know.

855
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,330
It's not trying to get your house.

856
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,010
It's like a helicopter.

857
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,090
Or something like that.

858
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:01,910
To get to your properties.

859
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,190
But it's not feasible.

860
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,110
You know what I'm saying.

861
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,450
It's not easy to do.

862
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:07,770
It's feasible.

863
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,470
It's not easy to do.

864
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:09,210
But.

865
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:10,850
But.

866
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:11,310
Part ends.

867
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:11,970
There's cross.

868
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,770
There's cross section.

869
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,370
See.

870
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,190
Case study.

871
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,010
The perfect chess engine.

872
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:16,510
Okay.

873
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:16,830
Now.

874
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,090
Dimensional game theory.

875
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,170
Decomposings.

876
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,230
Chasing to four.

877
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,970
Overlapping the short contents.

878
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:21,630
You know.

879
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,930
Each opportune of four.

880
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:23,630
Rejectorability.

881
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:24,970
Semantic resolution.

882
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,110
Detect dimension.

883
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,010
Capturing threats.

884
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:27,730
King pressure.

885
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,590
Protect the morphics.

886
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:29,930
This is like an attacker.

887
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,190
How to get capture.

888
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,450
You know.

889
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,910
The defence.

890
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,550
Protecting kings, pawns, structures.

891
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:34,070
Skip routes.

892
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:34,490
You know.

893
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,510
And then offence.

894
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:36,450
Spacing.

895
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,650
Piece activity.

896
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:38,290
Initiating.

897
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,350
This topics is more analytical.

898
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,330
But you know.

899
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,190
You can use the offence to your advantage.

900
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:43,750
You know.

901
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,330
But you know.

902
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,130
All of this is analytical.

903
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,590
You just have to solve the problem.

904
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,070
Conditional harmony.

905
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,650
Coherence.

906
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,630
And mobile pattern.

907
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,270
Mobility pattern.

908
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:51,710
You know.

909
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,530
That information.

910
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,130
Like you know.

911
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,770
Ensuring that you know, you risk a pawn.

912
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,230
You know.

913
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:56,770
Something.

914
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,570
You make it.

915
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,650
You make it.

916
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,550
You risk pawns.

917
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,550
Not the fool.

918
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,670
A fool work or something.

919
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,170
You know.

920
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,170
Or something that can.

921
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,410
The bishop.

922
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,270
Or something like that.

923
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,330
Like a queen.

924
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,790
Or something that the knights.

925
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,810
Something that can be used in another context.

926
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,190
You know.

927
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,710
You can call it like some sort of

928
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,050
defensive field, you know, it doesn't know what

929
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,570
you prioritise per se, you know, you know,

930
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,130
but you can practise or attack what you

931
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,330
want.

932
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,070
Because we are lacking any of the other

933
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,130
things, you know, there's an imbalance, there's a

934
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,810
drag, there's actually a second-graph imbalance.

935
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,550
The system will fail, ultimately, because you neglect

936
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,850
all the other ones, you know.

937
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,150
I don't think strategically, I mean, I don't

938
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,970
know the dimension if you want, you know.

939
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,550
The dimension is like the only isolated dimension,

940
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,530
they never overlap.

941
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,890
They never overlap.

942
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,010
You can quickly imagine whether you're modelling eyes,

943
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,510
but you never overlap.

944
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,990
Attack and defence, the core tactics.

945
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,530
Now, attacking an algorithm, defence, let me see

946
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:57,970
this algorithm.

947
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,510
F A, function A, function A, function D.

948
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,690
Now, this is F, the defence, function for

949
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,030
defence.

950
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,370
The text immediately captures, you know.

951
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,650
This is like a pose, you know, analyse

952
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,630
speed threats, compute skin pressure, identify tactics motif,

953
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,050
you know.

954
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,750
The motif is like the payoff of, like,

955
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,550
what the enemy is going to do, but

956
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,110
I'm going to exploit that with an attack.

957
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,550
It can be attack, attack the territory of

958
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,870
here.

959
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,590
But this, like, algorithm can be here, here,

960
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,650
because these are like these functions, you know.

961
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,230
You can add inputs, which is a pose,

962
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,310
you know, but they organise, they analyse speed

963
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,070
projections, evaluate the key safety, assess point structure,

964
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,330
you know.

965
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,370
These are dimensions, you know, different definitions.

966
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,370
The four, this change, these are decisions, you

967
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:41,490
know.

968
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,390
This is a set model, the decision set,

969
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:44,990
you know.

970
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,510
They're not even set, you know.

971
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,770
Can you unify one dimension?

972
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,610
Never use your hand, you know, or keep

973
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,390
the dimensions isomorphic to themselves, because this is

974
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,970
a problem you solve in one dimension, another.

975
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,670
You don't need to, basically, you don't need

976
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,590
to fragment the system.

977
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,290
There's no fragmentation whatsoever, you know.

978
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,610
The offence versus formation.

979
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,230
Now, offence is about long-term pressure, space

980
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,230
control, peace activity.

981
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,510
It's about slowing the enemy down, you know,

982
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,370
slowing the defence down, or slowing whatever piece.

983
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,730
Offence is more strategic, because it's about the

984
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,730
slowness of the system, trying to control this

985
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,910
design of what's happening on the board, but,

986
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:18,910
you know, it's invisible.

987
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,310
It's like that, it's like, you know, before

988
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,770
you know it, you use a piece that

989
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,390
you don't know, you know, but, you know,

990
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,770
it's about picking the right fights, you know,

991
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,670
and ensuring long-term sustainability of the system.

992
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,410
You know, for information, it's the harmony.

993
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,010
It's like, you know, collision, it's like, you

994
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,490
know, it's like a, it's like a, it's

995
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,370
like a, it's like a porn.

996
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:38,910
But that's not right, queen.

997
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,070
This formation is not good.

998
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,550
That means the formation is not good.

999
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,950
Because, you know, this is slightly imbalanced.

1000
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,090
I don't, I couldn't keep my formation.

1001
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,570
That means the travel formation.

1002
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,230
Because the solution didn't allow me to do

1003
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,570
my strategy, you know, you know, or do

1004
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,870
what I do with my formation.

1005
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,710
Because the information is intact, you know.

1006
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,830
The pose can be lost, or I can

1007
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,510
throw the pawns, or the pawns, or the

1008
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,750
little pieces, and keep all the big pieces

1009
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,110
in the game, you know, as a perfect

1010
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,530
formation.

1011
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,970
You know, because then there's a perfect formation,

1012
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:04,570
I resolve that.

1013
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,790
And then the offence is like the space

1014
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,210
control, making the enemy weak, weak, weak, you

1015
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,270
know, and making an example of the pieces

1016
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,450
they, the moves.

1017
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,990
And this is putting them psychologically, you know,

1018
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,450
you know.

1019
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,370
Red blue page, basically, this is like a

1020
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:19,470
move.

1021
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,250
No, no, no, no.

1022
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,130
This is a change in PR, probability of

1023
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,350
photo blue page is 0.6. Because, you

1024
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,590
know, this is an imbalanced vector.

1025
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,870
You know, this one says, you know, 7

1026
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,670
minus, 2.7 minus 1 is 0.6.

1027
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,430
You know, the largest probability of attack dimension,

1028
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:41,390
signals the collections of the advantage in red,

1029
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,770
you know.

1030
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,890
Because, you know, these dimensions represent attack, defence,

1031
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,030
offence, and information.

1032
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,170
You know, you know, as I'm saying, this

1033
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,910
is a probability scale, you know, and I'm

1034
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,290
sure that, you know, this one is coherent

1035
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,490
and can be reused, you know.

1036
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,670
You know, it's a perfect strategy, because the

1037
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,270
strategy, this is a model of vectors in

1038
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,890
the reward, you know.

1039
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,590
And, you know, that means the blue team,

1040
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,730
which are playing two defensively, are prone to

1041
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,070
losing the game, ultimately, you know.

1042
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,990
And they will lose, they've lost, you know,

1043
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,170
even before the game is started.

1044
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,590
Because the analytic framework for defence in the

1045
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,330
model, over the virtual one, over any attack,

1046
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,990
aggression, is imbalancing in the metric, you know.

1047
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,350
One to one minute, you know.

1048
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,230
You know, the 0.1 here represents just

1049
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,450
basically 0.7 or 0.1% attack.

1050
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,970
0.2 represent defence, or 0.6. 0

1051
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,890
.2 in the red probability of 0.6

1052
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,350
in blue.

1053
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:44,350
So basically, 0.7 minus 0.1 is

1054
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:46,750
0.6. And this 0.6 is PR

1055
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,610
minus PB.

1056
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,910
And this is probability of the red over

1057
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,210
blue attack versus defence.

1058
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,130
It's more over the dimensions of attack, defence,

1059
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,470
offence, and information.

1060
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,170
You know, these are just four dimensions that

1061
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,750
I also mean, at least these are dimensions.

1062
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,550
But they're no more than in the problem.

1063
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,710
And this is an imbalanced vector.

1064
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,930
You know, this vector is a triangle sign.

1065
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,270
I don't know, you know.

1066
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,350
The change, the change in, this means the

1067
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,870
change in.

1068
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,450
The change in, probability of R, you know,

1069
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,590
can be measured in real time.

1070
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,830
You know, that's what in the run time,

1071
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:18,530
in the robot, you know.

1072
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,490
It's a metric for defence coherence.

1073
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,610
How good your dimensions are doing, you know.

1074
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,410
How good you are.

1075
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,010
Detect.

1076
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,850
This is how opposite the strongest dimension.

1077
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,050
Neutralise.

1078
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,750
behaves as negative way to counter it.

1079
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,190
Redire shift focus to adjacent dimensions.

1080
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,410
Output the bending strategy, vector, you know.

1081
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,070
You know, some sensitive.

1082
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,450
So basically, it's a reverse 374.

1083
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,230
So basically, there isn't strong enough.

1084
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,830
Low appearance dimension.

1085
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,690
That's your worst case scenario.

1086
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,270
You don't want that thing getting underfunded.

1087
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,210
Neutralise the weight, the weight to counter it.

1088
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,210
So basically, now it's a more balanced view.

1089
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,190
That's a queen in the game.

1090
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,190
which redirects you from the statistic dimension and

1091
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,870
that's like the worst min-squares problem you're

1092
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,330
going to do it and the next one

1093
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,690
is like output the blended strategic vector you

1094
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,130
know now the blended strategic vector is like

1095
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,570
the executor of the vector in the road

1096
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,290
but you know it's like um so you

1097
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,510
get one detect 2D trace per redact you

1098
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,970
know and then that's new um forms a

1099
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,890
new um puts a new dimension there and

1100
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,050
gives you a probability score and that balanced

1101
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,450
probability score has been remeasured you know and

1102
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,050
that's after that's when the execution is taken

1103
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,970
place that's why it's real-time you know

1104
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,750
because you executed that in going new dimension

1105
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,530
but I mean dimension means that this variable

1106
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,750
of the dynamic thing but in a different

1107
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,790
context you know I have different objective you

1108
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,050
know you know uh using this you know

1109
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,710
same thing that's why the balance is measuring

1110
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,230
in real time okay now unicode security three

1111
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:49,310
now uh case study apply structural thing that's

1112
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,210
in cyber security the problem is multi encoding

1113
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,110
uh of the same attack vector bypass ratio

1114
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,650
files you know direct dot dot you know

1115
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,670
encoded basically the the encoded format the calculation

1116
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,250
does you know let me type this on

1117
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,730
a terminal this encoder format now the utf

1118
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,810
interpretation is problematic you know because you know

1119
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,230
these are these are these are traditional bypass

1120
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,390
filters you know because you know there's you

1121
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,010
know I can use this structural syntax to

1122
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,570
strike the problem multiple path encoding of the

1123
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,690
same attack vector bypass ratio filter so this

1124
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,030
I can put in this uh utf8 model

1125
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,910
of the encoder state and this will be

1126
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,350
you know I can I can uh encode

1127
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,830
this in utf8 you know you know but

1128
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:30,310
this was encoded into computer this is direct

1129
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,450
one this one's going to be a computer

1130
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,950
you know dot dot dot o2f you know

1131
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:36,270
every character but this utf calculation you know

1132
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,890
you know no this is an attack vector

1133
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,510
yes you know it's you know it's an

1134
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,950
attack vector you know because utf8 uh is

1135
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,050
not canonical you know you know this attack

1136
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,370
vector is the same as it can punch

1137
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,090
in the same you know or as a

1138
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,110
computer programme and it can bypass the root

1139
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,950
access dot dot you know if that is

1140
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:54,270
common direction or dot dot dot is like

1141
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,330
this one but this utf8 system doesn't understand

1142
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,630
uh doesn't don't think this is the encoding

1143
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,710
of the utf8 system uh which stands for

1144
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:07,410
unified uh unicode uh it's a unicode format

1145
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,370
of eight bytes of memory uh eight bytes

1146
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:13,570
eight bits to a one byte uh model

1147
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,490
uh what's called utf8 because it comes eight

1148
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,530
times eight it's got 64 bytes I think

1149
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,410
yes I believe so so basically I sort

1150
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,250
of wrote this concept you know I took

1151
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,130
a state different encoder I just path uh

1152
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,350
different encoders are just different paths to semantic

1153
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,510
states we collect them into still colour form

1154
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,110
the colour code form which is the simplest

1155
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,370
model that's used for the standard application of

1156
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,710
real world systems you know kind of code

1157
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,490
just means universal you know but it's the

1158
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:39,710
simplest form of the universal framework you know

1159
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,990
the kind of code form is the it's

1160
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,010
like um it's like you know ensuring that

1161
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,710
uh it's as long as it bugs a

1162
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,350
smoke reduction of states you know other states

1163
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:52,310
is chemical you know uh it's a feature

1164
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,250
it's a bug it's a feature it's not

1165
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,490
a bug you know you have to reduce

1166
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,510
all the all the code all the encoding

1167
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,990
you know one is to ensure that you

1168
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,690
cannot you cannot route out of your uh

1169
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,950
frame of records with any interface system provided

1170
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,390
by the user or the hacker state cia

1171
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,830
you know fly here a timer stop stop

1172
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,910
fly me fly so basically state side uh

1173
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,250
flash time that's what I'm saying using us

1174
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:23,490
in a unc uh uh gramme and three

1175
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,470
states recognition classical inputs are by code inside

1176
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,430
so map of the equivalent state in colour

1177
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,870
code form three apply for uh a single

1178
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,310
unified security policy you know the thing about

1179
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,730
this is like the recognition of the you

1180
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:40,230
cn your unicode um security uh characterisation of

1181
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,990
normalisation you know normalisation means like uh the

1182
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,790
the the smallest form so kind of code

1183
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,950
is just like the simplest one of course

1184
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,690
the normalise like one system can be one

1185
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,430
system but normalised form is called code form

1186
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:52,630
too uh and then this uh uh unicode

1187
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,090
uh structure uh uh uh colour code normalisation

1188
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,690
algorithms a three-phase pipeline the result of

1189
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:58,870
this
