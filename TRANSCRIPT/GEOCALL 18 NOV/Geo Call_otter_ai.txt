Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Go, this should work now, let me just try to,

Speaker 1  0:08  
okay, this is like my audio device, but I got the devices. I just want to mute them. Anything. Let's just mute them. I, you know, because I'm using too much audio devices anyway. So let me try to mute other devices. Audio devices. This is like, going on the system, but it's like, Okay, guys, let me just start the video instead, because it's gonna echo back, but it doesn't need to echo back, so I'm gonna mute it myself, but I can hear I can't hear myself. So basically, I got two mics running simultaneously. Let me just like microphone, default mic. So now the default mic is, one is being used. There's, you know, it can't echo back to me. Let me see my sound. Okay, guys, let me start recording this. Okay, recording this. Recording this here. Okay, let's do this. I've got to do this. Okay, guys, I need to focus now. Shut the up. Voice in my head, no meeting with myself. Focus on

Unknown Speaker  1:06  
your work only, yep.

Speaker 1  1:12  
So basically, yes. So guys, this video is very punishment. You understand? What's the bonus of it? Basically something called the function call library. Would you call two more? Jessica, it's very important you guys understand the program. First approach for political@github.com forward slash, O, B, I N, E, x, u, x4, slash, I L, I B, P, o, l, I L, Y, C, A, that one's program first. But, you know, the program runs is the interface. So I need you guys understand that's just a program. It's on Power Program. So he's gonna send it to geocode, has to have like, two, you know, guys, guys, you know, geococks, have two, because in C, the geoco interface in C some kind of higher level language and lower level language. But, you know, like, conceptually, obviously, like two apps. You like a library, yes, but you got, like a library system that, like lip political shared objects, or DLL or Dilip for Macintosh systems. Got the lip political system, and then you got the geocode system, which are the same system, but they are different libraries, but your core is gonna have a runtime library, real time interpreter, like a Python system. Geocode is a Jamal funk on core library, which I got my notes here, but on call library, but that's a geocode. So geocode works as intended, but geocode is geomorphic. It works around geometry. But what is a runtime? So you got to interpret the compile Language Interpreters runtime only. You do need to compile it, just interpret it. So I'm trying to develop some kind of artifact that is a shared object library between our system. So can give you a program to run, or like a Python our system, Obi elf or hot off, but you know, it's like, ensure that everything is uniform, uniform data process according to whether the chemical organization of the system was across the polyglot so geocool@github.com

Unknown Speaker  3:18  
OBI, Nexus, four, slice,

Unknown Speaker  3:20  
go, D, E, O, C for Charlie, A for

Speaker 1  3:23  
alpha, alpha Lima, alpha Li. But that one has to have, like a runtime world, and it's basically like a problem system. You know, if I can compile a program, it's gonna make it like a simulate the entire universe, observer, universe, compile. So this is just an idea came from. If I compare from. If I compile the project, you know, I have to wait for this entire organization to run. And that's really, you know, see what see inside of my data. So it's like a duality problem, because, you know, you know, I rather have a runtime now based on my observation of the world that can grow after the reward. If I want to see, observe the non observer, one can't see or measure. Basically about observing and observing, you know, I can observe the universe. I can see from my locality, but you know, my issues can pick up locality. So basically, my system is not isolated, so it's interesting. So geocodes can work on interpreter, Python, after executable and linkable format for political systems. That's Linux and Windows. You know what is? Computers, Chromebook computers. We're going to understand here is geocoll. Allows you to use some executable looking format directly. So basically, if you go to geocoll, if you try to buy geocoll, I don't guess, but try to go somewhere, you know, you run out of like, interest place. You want to compare the whole journey route you know, you took to get to the rush station, because that's also it was time when you're going from here to, like, a Korea or half around the world. You want geocode to be coherent. I'm doing this job too. Okay, okay, basically, let's start with ma'am. Model. She's guys me at the center. It's like my models. So basically I'm the center. I'm the one autism, it is.

Unknown Speaker  5:10  
And this was a whales, like

Speaker 1  5:14  
a model. Basically it's like the OT arena, or the sphere, the fear in America, crowd you know, can get a crowd in there and have an event, you know. You know, gonna have the biggest event in there, you know. But you know you all have to be the center, because everyone see you from any angle, from anywhere of the world. You know, it doesn't matter how even enter the place you go there, you get yourself sorted out, get a party, get sorted out. You know, basically doesn't make some sports crypto measures, but you know that will come later, because you know the security measures have to take. Who don't abuse the framework already, you can see, like, people like, are they the Queen auditor? Things like that. That way offenses happen there for days and nights. If you give them a king you have, like,

Unknown Speaker  5:59  
a week. You can grab like a three day or two day party last night and day

Speaker 1  6:04  
for a week. That's 14 days, because that's a case of my thing right now. So I'm designing around me and something more constitutional. But you also get to the arena. Go there for 14 days, like 14 days and 14 nights, Seven Days, Seven Nights is a day. Anyway, Seven Nights is a day. So no assumptions. Seven Nights, Seven Nights is 7x 797, days, day and night is a party, but that's two weeks of a party. But you know, that's not what we'll tell you, because, you know, noon equals Day. Day equals noon, you know? So basically this, this circles around the topology. So I'm the center the I'm a certain human give my speech, anything. I'll give my party, everything I'm sending attention. I can move, but I don't have to move this model. So the fish keep moving, the wheels around me, and the wheels are basically, you get, like, bigger wheels in front, Little Big wheels, and you get bigger ways in the center, and they get small. The worst case modeling, basically, I'm basically just like an ocean model gives you something in the ocean. Why do you need to be? Why didn't you be on the surface? You know, can go anywhere, you know, you can go on underground, underground and go to go to the earth, and go through the Atlantic, you know, and say, Yes. Basically, I'm all of this. Basically, the wheels can echolocate, you know, echolocated, same ways to me, to communicate with me. You know, if I can speak to them, You know what? They confuse the Creole. I can get the food, but it works for them, you know. Why not us? You know.

Unknown Speaker  7:36  
So you got the

Speaker 1  7:39  
wall, you got the plain one got, like a sparse model, feel safe, proud person model, but, you know, I don't want to talk about topology for topology system. It's really about photos model, but all based on language coherence. And you know how much understand one can say model to do it, the model is good enough to start with, like the structure of the system is still enough to be coherent structure before syntax. So basically the syntax is not the language the pattern minded language. So

Unknown Speaker  8:11  
I can use something called

Unknown Speaker  8:13  
a sparse a sparse audit

Unknown Speaker  8:15  
XYZ code system simply

Speaker 1  8:19  
language model. So basically x, y plus y, both sides of the spectrum. But you know, if you have a plus 160, minus one, have a one man, but it's x, y, z. So the X is like the language coherence that you know, how form of the language is, you know, informal language, like, Yo, what's up? That's a form of land. But you mean it can be formal to me, you know, because it's informal duality, because you know informal to me. But why talking? You know, this is not a frame of reference, you know, to formal languages. You know, informal to me, in that spectrum, very formally, like the company, you know, you know the company or governance like you know, you know, you get a plus x sub. Once you go like formal plus two, formal plus a minus plus minus minus plus x formal, informal, basically the positive. They just say they conjugate for each other. Because, you know, we relay information based our frame of reference, you know, the minimum locality, which is the worst case in Australia. So you just govern anything yourself. You know, by direction, to learn from a governor, to learn English. You know, in government, high authority, you never would use that language. You don't need that then you just never get your own way. You know, with your people, you know what is free top language. So basically, unit testing for language, the Y getting is like minus y plus y, so the minus one plus Y is like, no good. It's like, basically you got integration. Basically the minus one is up for my formal, sorry. Okay, so the Y Gage is of X gate. Sorry.

Unknown Speaker  9:55  
Is factual, the fact,

Speaker 1  9:58  
the fact, how. The fact this is a fact of friction, you know, and then how you relay this widget. So the plus Why is on formal to formal coherence. Formal, formal, informal. That's why you get, like the friction. You can make it up. If you make it up, that's execute. Now the Y get is a form, and now you get the PRP models. So like, you know, really, of the open set framework. So if I send someone like a fictional factual basically how well I can understand new information, new things based on a cognitive cognition model, which is called as gated hallucination engine. So even cannot misinterpret my wife say, so, consciousness computer, you know, if computer do something, act on something, is a code condition, and my ability to do it, you know, it's like my observing, my ability to do it based on how I've been trying to do it, you know,

Unknown Speaker  10:52  
because I'm not robot. But maybe

Speaker 1  10:55  
next up, so let's go my geocode. So basically, geocode in the sea, if you have a latitude, longitude and model based on lattice deformation, basically, this is basically something that can navigate the robot in any biome. So you get like a latitude, which is like the globe latitude. That's the x1 the x1 you get latitude of Capricorn. The Tropic of Capricorn. The Tropic of Capricorn is at the top. No, no, yes, the truth of cancer is at the bottom. But you know, that's not bottom to us. That's like Arctic up down, you know. But you know, depending on your frame of reference, it's not up or down from side to side. There's nothing like that, you know. Come only to frame a chemical problem as even as a uniform chemical problem shared resolution. Then there's just relativity. You know, this is just problems, but just relativity. So please prove that for me that says, you know, so that's XYZ, latitude, longitude and lattice. Basically the latitude is like the xy, up, down, minus x anything that affects the XY union minus transformation using the functional frameworks, lattice, and I did a lattice, and then the raw pitch. And ya, raw picture. Yeah, am I going to 15 minutes? No, I should have gotten to something. Now I don't really know. Basically, I'm saying to you that row is like, the x row, the pitch is a row, yaw. The row basically something rolls, or rules like a ball, rock, a wheel, rows, it's using the X is already rolling on the x axis. It doesn't need to roll. And that's called a row. Now the pitch is like, it's all screams. The pitch goes high.

Unknown Speaker  12:38  
That's what's called a pitch. And the yaw, it's

Speaker 1  12:41  
like, you know, yeah, basically, you know, getting basically, that's, I know, it's, you know, that's why, because I remember that from Biafra. So basically, the road is like a roll of something, a wheel on a road, something moving on a straight axis. The pitch is like the resonance of the frequency,

Unknown Speaker  12:58  
or the users

Speaker 1  13:02  
to the kind of change as factors that are for threat. Basically a roll is like something rolling down the hill, but that of a fast face, you know, if I throw, if I roll a ball, that will go slow and slow, or slow a bit subsection of the surface or whatever. But that's only computed now, you know, because I'm not, I'm not gonna be delayed in the sea, whether it's a pressure, something, it blows up, or something, you know, don't be included. So basically, the when I go down, the pitch goes down. I go down, but then my ship start. Then the IK sips, analysis principle, then fix a hold of my shift. And I know to go up. If I don't go up, the ship go up automatically to resurface. But, you know, for something I need, but, you know, the pitch and the yaw is like a roll, pitch, yaw, basically the X, Y axis. Because, you know, I can go straight, I can go up sideways. But, you know, this side is not there. This is not actually, this is a 2d plane, because I do X, Y, but it's like a projection. That's all projection matrix, really. So I can project myself. If I'm an X and a Y, I'll call it z like that, because that's another dimension I'm adding. So basically, all the dimensions you're going to add to the last problem. So you got a 4d clustering to 3d clustering algorithms, which I'll come to now,

Unknown Speaker  14:17  
write that down here.

Unknown Speaker  14:20  
So it's like, you know, okay, so you got, like, a

Speaker 1  14:23  
precise point, a precise point, but that point is not already a point in the real world. So it's an area, an area, basically an area is a point, you know, punching that, you know, but that point has a infinitely dense area. So that means the, you know, we don't observe this because it's like, it's so small we can't, we can't observe it, like, without measuring tools, but infinitely this we can't, can't compute past infinity. You know, because infinity is uncountable, uncountable too, unless you, unless you, unless you like, some breaks. You can observe infinity, but you can't. Can't do anything with some infinity constructs. We can. I don't know about that. Let's not, let's go there, but you know, it's. You can look at something called a point. The point is dense, infinitely dense. You just call a point. It's just a location. I go there, come down, you know, it could be me, can be my house, or my room or my you know where it is, but I can physically get there, but I cannot. If someone should come there, it's like an infinite, dense point. So they don't have to know enough information to get there. You're saying, because it's fast, how I got there, you know, to get there, you know, I'm saying you don't tell them all information. I can never get there. You can never get that precise point, an area point. So basically, got two models on this. You got, like, a precise point, which means, like, it's precise. You can find it based on information. You got the accurate point. So it's like a cluster system. So if I go to, like, a public space. If I want to go through a more private processing space, I go to a precise point. Hence my position model of the other one I do. So basically the precise point on a precise area, you know, just like so I can trust you guys with price points. But, you know, after gonna go in the real world, you know, just make sure that you guys are doing stuff to play my position. You know, position. Have good right services, interpreter models for the clustering. Let me try to do that now. So basically the 4d dimensional reduction problem, basically the world is 4d so we're going to try to assume the worst of each so the world can be for the projection of ad system 40 something for the big bang that gives both the system, which is our universe that's in the worst case scenario, it's gonna be true. We're gonna assume it's true in the worst case only because we're gonna optimize for the worst case, never the best case, and then the worst case is true. So the system gets better. So the best case is this, the point, the point of the system, like, you know, if it's the if Stephanie comes from a worthy system, and it gets good 3d system, you know, we have to reduce all this problem to easily. We can model this problem in the space, but it's not going to be accurate if it really space, because we know we come from a folder we are used above working for 40 but know, this earth, you know, we don't have the proof. So we have to optimize for the worst case. And that's I'm doing with this dimension system. So for the tensor is just a matrix on top of metrics. It's like a biome system. So the matrix can represent like, like, you know, one one place, or one biome, another buying on top of that biome, which, like a two bank. The Park is a one biome because, you know, there's animals and ducks that live there, but humans don't leave that because not their biome to live there, like Valentine's Park and the other ones, like the community park, the Royal This is a rural, rural setting in the community, but then urban settings is a dual citizen, or the bio and the Royal biome in but doesn't really mean anything. It just means that the point error system has been coherent around the space. You mean the decision should be recovered without hallucinating new stuff. Which brings me much of my next idea, 47 layers model as a 3d system in the 46 can be coherent enough. Basically, enough, basically believing the two bands. This is basically a three by three by three matrix, because, you know, you got the unit automatically, because you understand that. You know, if you don't study, don't understand the XYZ and go to x, y, z, 123, I can pick a location anywhere in Valentine's part, and call this the matrix for Valentine's part. Or, you know, y1, y2 because, you know, x1, y1, x2 x2 y2, y3, x3 you know, these are three by three automatically. Why? Because, because Valentine's pop defined by this matrix, this past matrix. Now this sparse matrix is called input matrix, because you can model this with a Cartesian plane or a polar system. Doesn't matter how I model it, as long as you can reduce that problem into the other problem, you know, and get the pop. You know, the image of the pop. You know my navigation through the park system. So the XYZ three by three because, you know, we have three dimensions XYZ. But I'm even through my rural system to the to get to the park. No, I'm not in the park only. So just, even this is just one biome. So the tensor is like, you know, as you get another three by three for where I'm at my rural to get to the park, you know. So I can find some kind of transformation function, find this data, so I can get from here today functions only, you know, because I don't want any inputs that's arbitrary. There's no need like Google APIs or something like that. I don't want any of that, you know. I want my own thesis to be coherent with my minimal without any overhead in the system, because it's just all methods of computation and motion reduction.

Speaker 1  19:52  
So basically, yes, human, basically the photon model, human object systems. So you got one to five, one. One in 611, danger, seven to 611, four to 18, critical and 1925, fail safe, basically a low, medium high, low, medium high, which is three low, low medium, medium high and high errors. We do exception model to practice. So at associate one, start recovering. Basically, things are fragmented. This is this algorithms to solve the problem. You know, just automatically when you build any stuff. But you know, you also have like things like the error systems, you know, so they can go up or bubble up to no errors for the actual human absolute systems or hotel services are sparse models and the first system must never panic. Should be no panic in each system. Is my thing? Done, almost done. Let me just stop and start again. First stop and see if you guys are stopping now. Oh, stop file. Save us, save us.

Unknown Speaker  21:07  
Export Audio.

Unknown Speaker  21:10  
No geopole, runtime,

Unknown Speaker  21:13  
wow, boost, drop, wow. This one

Unknown Speaker  21:18  
now, found you, found you.

Speaker 1  21:22  
I Okay, false. Like I was saying the Celsius system for the sparse model. What's the sparse model? Almost a sparse function. Basically a sparse model is like a weapon model. X, as you know, can be a consistent system, or post system, or lat system. It's just be a system that isomorphic substrate isomer to isotope without basically all the chemical specification of the system must maintain the minimum coherence for that conversation. For example, if I invest like a normalization of a system the conversation of a chemical like, you know, backslash, forward slash, which still happens today. Basically when I type on backslash in Windows, I get a user's path. I get a backslash. I can use that to navigate C directories and system files on my files, because you have to put a backslash, not to forward slash, you know, forward slash in Windows, yes. But I can put a backslash if I want to put two back faces, you know, two backpackers in the system and get one forward slash, no two batteries equals one, four slash. It's kind of an encoding problem. In some scene, it's like a, kind of like LCU is basically the LCU have, like, a dash, PKF. Like, you know, you know LCU, that's PKF. You know that dash is a problem, you know? Do you understand it's a problem just come you know, just one encoding windows, basically two backslashes. It's not just one kind of cool four slash for Windows, but you have a WsL window something, you get a one four slash. You know, you can type two backlashes again. Can escape the system, because the system you escape it arbitrary, without Without question, enough to add a more external command overflow, because, you know, the system doesn't observe the state. Doesn't watch you enough to action it. So basically, this two, four backslash, you can try it on Windows today. I don't really care. Escape you like a amperset in hexadecimal. You can execute that hexadecimal cancer said in Linux, you know, with the script. If I'm wrong, you know, I don't really care, because I pass it. But you know, you can move that one forward slash, you can go dot, dot, you can get two dot, dot backslash, escape the system's root access. Basically, it's like a simulation model. So you can go to root. This is like a dot, dot dot for backslash, two dot backslashes one route, and then you can go to one forward slash, and then two dot, dot dot backslash is that's Windows root for Linux. You can try that guys run a program that system to see whether Microsoft does anything, because they don't do anything anymore. So basically, I'm seeing team is this false model. What's your coherence? You know, like this kind of chemical system. But you know, across all systems, you can system for the error current system and something called anti hallucination. So the sparse model must change coherence, because, you know, even anti hallucination as people. So basically, this is a muscle hallucination solutions. You know, you can make solutions that work, that work for the short term or the long term. You know, local maximum, minimum and local maximum. But target goals, you know, like small goals and big goals, large goals, the biggest goal, you know. So let's say to like, Master and the system can do it without using AI, because I don't guys use AI because it's just, it's just anybody that add AI to Google Maps. Don't give a shit, you know, because you guys are not even doing your job no more. Because, you know, the system is just a quote, unquote, I'm a quota system. And plan my routing plan, you know, but that's just almost give me all the things to get from point A to point B without breaking sweat, you know, because that's why I pay for that service, Google, APIs.

Unknown Speaker  24:52  
So, um, I.

Speaker 1  25:00  
Observe consumer town. So basically, you got it for town. Basically for me, I say I want to go to the library, religious library, observe my state, and I go there. But, you know, observe. I don't know. I'm just gonna get there. I don't care what my scene, because basically there's no point. Basically, I observe everything you go there, but you know, that's just redundant for me. Basically, I don't need to see it. Sees for me? If I say I'm gonna get to a BBC, I don't mean I want to see everywhere I go, stop whatever, to a corner, buy some food, go. I don't get to a B, you know, I go outside. I come from a, I go to B, I go for B, I go to a back. That's what I want. No, A, B, in the back. Guys stop this nonsense. Basically, guys,

Unknown Speaker  25:40  
uh to inform your service. More you.
