This is not what I recorded, so this is my other one recording, so you can record it. No, okay, let me use it. Okay, basically, let's continue the video.

Okay, basically, guys, I can see myself now. So, basically, the mission of this is like an authentic housing. You know, you're gonna have quotes in a kennel, your house, your dog, you know.

But let's go freely up and down the house, you know, to business too. You know, basically, I'm thinking of this. Basically, again, I have like a fish system, like a system of fish, you know, you're gonna have fish there, you know, and it's gonna be weird.

Basically, you can have like a pond in the system, but, you know, that's for the fishes. And they can have like their own kennel where they can interact with you, you know, where the fishes are, you know, animal friendly people. I love animals, you know.

But the kennels are the, like, where they can breathe with you, live with you, and work with you. You know, put guys, nothing to the animals, guys. Guys, not, no, no, no, I don't trust you guys.

I don't trust you guys. But, you know, like, you're kind of a dog over there, and cats over there, you know, something like that. But, you know, I can't take care of it.

But, you know, I don't want to take care of the cats or anything, but I'm in the middle of corn, which I'm looking at, you know, because, you know, I don't want to feed the cats, you know. So, this is why the corn is very important. The tissue is very important.

So, I'm thinking, I'm thinking of this. So, you're gonna have a house for the animals, but that don't have the home. Basically, you're gonna have the home in the house, but they don't have to navigate the thing, whatever the house is, you know, because, you know, they don't just find their own food, you know, whatever the tissue is.

So, you can have like a little biome in there, so the cats can get their fish, you know, and the fish can put more fish any time, you know. You know, they can put in more fish, more fish into the pond. The pond will come into your garden, and, you know, the pond will sustain the fish's growth, you know, under the catfish, you know.

And there's a mice even, guys, guys, guys. I don't do mice in the other trashy place. Basically, I have two food for your cats, you know, because the cat can be, you know, but guys, guys, you know, I want to show that the animal is dead and that there's no running away, because, you know, I want cats and mice.

Toots are called natural fruit, you know. You don't feed them, you know, something that you can use, you know. There's one, there's the animals, too.

This condition, I know. They're meant to be there, live in there, because, you know, all this biological stability. If it's a cat or a dog in the world, the vermin, the rats and the densers appear, you know.

You don't see them, you know, because they are natural predators in the wild, anyway. My customs, you know. Because, you know, that's what I'm saying, because they're just like, we just change that domain, because, you know, we just, like, you know, do something to them.

You know, just gently or breed them. And there's even no breeding of animals, you know. You know, guys don't breed animals in my condition.

That's the point, you know. You know, you come to me to breed animals or breed with you, you know. Basically, it's not the same.

It's like, you know, the fishes and the diversity of the fish has to be like a coyote, some kind of a biome for the fish. But the biome for the fish should be 100%, like, you know, 90%, 10%, 15% of the fishes that will get eaten based on the cats and the dogs and the animals that breed in the condition. Because they're going to live there, you know.

Because, you know, if you're sustaining yourself there with money and stuff, you should have to be able to sustain the animals. And that's the policy now. So, basically, the animals are there to sustain you.

So, if you feel like you don't talk to a human being, you go to put your dog or your cat, you know. That's why I wanted you guys, you know. And both of you guys are human beings.

I'm just going to say to you guys, it's the policy now. So, the cats, dogs, and the raccoon, anything you talk to, anything you want to sustain, you know, you can interact with it if you can connect to it. Well, then it's fishes.

It's not my problem, you know. Can we feed money? It's not my problem. But, you know, you have to be sure there's enough food for them.

Basically, you're going to have to think about the house. You can see it looks like a room. It looks like a fish here, a fish thing here.

I can pump it up with oxygen, whatever. But the fish go up, up, up, up, and live their life, you know, up the stream, you know, because they want to jump over those things. And they should be able to do that too, because, you know, it's fish life, not your life.

You know, you've got to tell the fish that, you know, give them sprinkles on, you know. They don't feed the fishes, you know, or they have an issue with their tail. So, stealing themselves, not the animal around them, which is why they have to do that, you know.

Because, you know, I can use that applause to research other things, not your sexual life. And if it comes to your life, like, see anything with that compound, you have to see that the fish are not fed in there, or the sun is not happening correctly, you know. And the system's set up everything.

I think it's the explosion system. Guys, guys, guys. What do I do? Because it be out of the constitution.

And I'll take that thing, because it be banned from that place forever. No, no, no, no. For 24 years.

For 25 extra years. For this year, you know, because you're like, we're trying something new with human beings. I'm trying to understand what we were thinking in the robot, you know.

Like, for me, I understand. I can see it. I can, I guess it's like a bunker.

Basically, you're like, me? One seems to do everything. Like, it means to me, if I'm in a bunker, and someone died in a bunker, it's because the bunker's not stable. The bunker, which is still stealing them.

Well, people die alone in a bunker, like, you know, shots of the bunkers, you know, things that are meant to stop bomb blasts, and they can't even stop a human being killing people in the bunker. You know. Those things must stop, guys.

You know. Because the bomb blast is not, it's the problem. It's not even the problem.

It's the human who set the bomb, but the bomb is the human who wants to kill the people. So, why is the human coming to the people who wants to have a bomb? It's not how humans work. It's not how human design, human protection works.

It's not, I'm quoting human protection. So, this kind of thing I want to stop. If you care for yourself, your girlfriend, you become like a radical.

Like, you know, trying to do something to your, I wanted the system. Let's even do it against you directly, you know, like, you know, the cat would tell the dog, the cat would go to the mice, you know, and then we'll find out what you're doing, you know, because, you know, no monopoly, the sexual identity, you know, you can pay for it. You can just do, I want to see it within there.

You know, I don't want to see it within there. I'm tired of it. But after seat, because I wrote a constitution, I had to put that in the system.

So, like, you know, I wanted one, basically like the aunt. So, you got a kennel. It was like a human kennel for a dog.

I got the human, the dog's house, which is just for the dog's space, breeding space, living worker space. I got the dog's space. You must see the dog's name cats every day, you know, in their house, in their kennel.

You know, if they don't talk to you, guys, if they don't talk to you, what do you think? You know, if they run away from that building, guys, and come to me, guys, or someone else, how do I read this? I want to know. I want to know, because animals are small, so, you know, and that's why I have that kind of infrastructure there. It's just for, it's not to protect you, it's to protect me, because, you know, the dog is scared of you.

I need to kill that dog, and I don't see that dog, and that dog has a collar, and come on, check out that dog. you shouldn't build it. Guys, I don't want you guys to have too much power there anyway, with this kind of thing I'm doing here.

I can see it, but I can do a lot of things, you know. One master bedroom, one big bedroom, one plaza, a corn, LG, VTQ, big corn, small corn, lesbian, gay, bisexual. I'm gay, I'm bisexual, but seriously, I have a light feminine side, and a strong masculine side, but they do work together, but I'm not a woman, so I have a reflection of, by the racist critique, I'm polygamous.

My dad has four husbands, four wives, but five wives, grew my mother, but she rarely wants his polygamous. He's a mightly, but he's a king, and then Jesus, so I took after him, I guess. And basically, when you have a child there, in that plaza, you know, you can take the animals and that plaza, and the house in that plaza, that's your bedroom house, you guys, you guys can have that plaza, that's your children's home, guys, I will never take it away from you, you know, guys, that's your home, that's where you put your home.

And if that child wants to keep that, you know, the fishes are fed, all the things you fed her, you know, because, you know, I want you in a way, eating the animals, to know what's going on, you know, you can start immigrating animals' minds that way. But, you know, when a dog doesn't listen, or bites his own leg, you know, in a perfectly biome that's designed for it, you know, are you questioning, what's happening there? I'm trying to, I'm showing that you guys never get something nice like that again, you know, it's too good for you, the money is too good for you, so do you. Baby on the floor, basically, everything is a mystery on the floor, basically, you meet with two levels, height and life and work, life and work, but, you know, breath and work, breath life, work life, but, you know, I want to ensure that you get that, you know, So, you know, if you go to the top floor, and there's a fishes over there, you can clean that mess up, you know, this is what's been so silly, biological, sustainable, easy to clean, easy to manage, you know, so you can get over your day, you know, and just get over there, you know, and just get over there, you can feel me, and I should be seeing these two people understand, basically, the fishes go to the toilet, and I can see the toilet.

See the dirty toilets, some in the toilet, and then I can see them, because I look after the fishes, you know, but then they come to what? To use the toilet, you know, the fishes toilet. So, that's the thing I'm going, The, your toilet is the fishes toilets too. The, your cat's toilet is my cat's toilet.

cat's toilet, you know? Unless it's the two toilets, you know, they can't go on a toilet, but the candle is your shed, that's your house, you know? But, no, the candle, that's kind of a broom, But it's kind of like a like a house story. So basically it's like a like in a because they meant to be interacting with themselves. Nothing you Except for etc. 

What else animals are meant to be Symbiotic with you, you know, you miss me to communicate with them playing with them, you know, and then getting bored of them I'm doing it one thing, you know, what's wrong with you? But the foundation is the animal to care for the animal and we care for your child You know, you know and if you care for the child enough, you have a child of your own, you know So that's the idea behind the whole onion system. It's like, you know, let's repeat the layers of your identity Welcome preserve the mask of your of your room the masking Start masquerading and preserving itself putting your attempt to get persona through that to navigate a scenario You know in real time and make sure your cheese better. No, you don't depend on anyone else You know doesn't say so the two-bedroom one master bedroom, you know, it's much to unite everyone Can obviously this not basically I'm thinking of like some kind of a canopy system firstly I sit outside I don't know what Sally I I go to the canopy. 

I go to my kennel where I see You know, but you know, what does kind of starlight then I put a little glass over me I lie on the back and I then sleep there and I can sleep there But then I can show the light and I've been so quiet cuz I'm gonna come out and this is the compass are fenced There's security by design. So basically I But you know the faces are not The security of the design is Architecture because you know the architect of the housing it's not a house itself The compound as a policy not even a house say it's not gonna come to house and stop your Killer on one child, but basically this is a security measure But you know if the if there's this design of the system Isn't a good not give me Economically inclusive for them inviting to them. They will never be Getting it because he's just mitigating whatever the stress was, you know, that's what gets to happen whether there's a dog dog over there But you know the dogs other kind of dogs everything must know that you know, it's really for you as well Cuz he's an animal or things that they cannot know you before you before he's good those off You know in and die in your sleep You know, I'm thinking of like having some kind of a mode system Let's have a little system. 

That's not AI bound Cuz you know, you have the AI good animal We don't feed animal everything you have to feed animal. Yes, cuz you know, you get to learn about animals now You know you have to like ensure that the animal is equitable Show that you're interested in your they live there naturally. Actually, that's their house, you know, that's their crib You're you should go to their crib not the other way around. 

Oh 40 minutes has passed. Okay, let me stop this now stop Guys guys stop this recording. I stopped this to basically stop
