1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,359
happens.

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,160
Oh, this is stopped. Uh, it's

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,160

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,560
Okay, guys. One second, guys.

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,760
Okay. Hello guys. Okay. Today's video I

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
want to really talk about something

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,920
really hard. It's something I call, you

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,920
know, I'm trying to steal everyone's

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,840
aura in the past. People actually can

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,239
help us. You know, for me, I think it's

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,559
just one initiative. I'm taking to for

12
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,920
them because may not know the solution

13
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,799
to a problem. You know, it's called PLP

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,159
principle as a protocol. You know, guys,

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,720
today's video is very important to me.

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,479
You know, it means something uh to me as

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,479
a child. Basically, someone called Mr.

18
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,479
Sim

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,840
basically Mr. Sim was a teacher of

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
French, you know, he was a good French

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
teacher. I love that man, you know. You

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,000
know, but no student, you know, it was a

23
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,479
first year school. We need to talk to

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,799
you about Mr. Mr. Mr. You know, you

25
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:34,720
know, I had to had to really look at him

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,040
like like him as he was. You know, you

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,200
have to find out, you know, why it was

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,920
that way. You know, it was strict in

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,680
class. It was it wasn't like hard

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
anything. It wasn't wasn't hurting

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
anyone physically, but he knew how the

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,280
system works. You know, he's telling us

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,799
about our lives. He talk he's teaching

34

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
Teacher I loved, you know, I loved him

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,560
cuz he he was able to communicate

41
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,120
effectively to me and not to others but

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,440
in a more African way, you know, but it

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
was it was modest. It wasn't like pushy.

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
It was like you do it or not, you fail,

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,680

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,480

is a great thing to understand you know

88
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,799
Mr. Slim didn't know everything. He

89
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
doesn't know everything. But he was able

90
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,480
to communicate birectionally. That's two

91
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,239
languages. You know, he can go to French

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
class and mingle. You know, you can go

93
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
to English class and mingle. You know,

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
was able to navigate the system, you

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
know, much better than me at the time. I

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,639
can go French at the time, you know. But

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,320
he's able to relay good communication

98
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,240
very well guys able to even speak pigeon

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,080
or like African like the broken English

100
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,440
or the slang in UK and talk for you go

101
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
through everywhere. You can't go to

102
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,560
neighborhood. You can't go to the

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,639
accepted guys. You know if you speak a

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
street talk only can't go through the

105
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
parliament do for processes do legal

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,080
actions you know things are very formal

107
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,680
you know you can't do it you know it's

108
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,280
no way. So that's why birectional

109
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,720
learning is very important. What does it

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
mean to you? You know, you speak

111
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
English, I speak French. You know, you

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,360
can still communicate with one language.

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,560
You know, English, you know, if you I

114
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,759
speak French, you speak English. You

115
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
want to speak French.

116
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,720
This this really means a lot to me,

117
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
guys. You know, I'm not doing it for the

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
crowd. I'm doing it because it's

119
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,960
mother's honest, you know. I want to

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,600
think um think of me, you know, you

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
know, actually making something better

122
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
for everyone else, you know. I want to

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
think of him me as he succeeded, you

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
know.

125
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,680
You may not know what this means to me,

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
but you know if you only know one

127
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,720
language, it doesn't mean anything to

128
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,720
me. I mean policing

129
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,479
