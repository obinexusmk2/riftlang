Services. Oh, hello, Joe, basically

Speaker 2  1:00  
came here today when someone else again, assessed me for assessing, trying to assess me, give me more medication and tell me I'm not all right, which I've heard enough of. But you know, they don't have one job to do another section. So basically tell them, I need my data sent to Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, my to the Council. The Council, the second of all, second of all, tell them, I want my case closed, Nnamdi.

Unknown Speaker  1:31  
Nnamdi, Mr.

Speaker 2  1:36  
Nnamdi, tell them to close my social care. So I'm leaving anyway. Yes, madam, madam, madam, madam, just tell them I don't want to talk to you anything I want. Just passing the message. Tell them I'll pass it on and say that you want your social record closed. No, no. Tell them. Notice. Why said? I should tell them again, put myself, tell them to close my social care contract under the social care visit five. I don't want social I don't want to do their job. They don't do their job. I don't care. So basically, they don't want an IMTA. Give me two IMCA for restitution. Anyway, I don't really care. Just tell them that I'm leaving myself now. I don't want to do any more assessments. If they don't give me a house, it's fine. Nobody care. Tell them I don't give a shit.

Unknown Speaker  2:27  
That's how they want to interpret

Speaker 2  2:32  
it. Okay, I'll pass that message, not the S word, just see what I'm saying. Because I don't know why. When I see something goes all the way it goes all the way you want them to know that you want to you want them

Unknown Speaker  2:40  
to know that you want to close your social care

Unknown Speaker  2:45  
contract. Yes, forever. Yes, you're

Speaker 2  2:49  
leaving. And if they can't offer you a house, yes, you can just give me my data and send it to the council, not a quarter. So they don't know what quarters. I don't really care. Basically, my data, when they come to this address, tell them to send it to Cambridge City Council, court, city council, because I'm going to do my PhD there. Because you live within, I don't care. Tell them to put the scene that if they won't send it to this address, you know, come back and collect my data from this address anyway if they send it here vaccine. But that seven day request must be amended by, you know, just to take all that detail, send by email and send it to Cambridge Council, because I'm going to Cambridge today. Of today. Funny enough for my PhD. But, you know, they just insulted me and telling me your mentor session again. So I'm leaving. Thank you. Thank you. Would anybody believe they can do it? I can't do it. Tell them what support giving me to do it, you know, let's practicalize this. They know how this works, you know? You know, if they want to help or not, it's not my problem. I don't want to happen anymore. I don't give it. I don't really care. You know, they had one job, one job. I'm going to Cambridge today, my life again. They'll meet with my lawyers and people that are protecting me because I got money to buy personnel by security for someone going there. Thank you very much, Madam. All right, take care. Foot. On, okay.

Unknown Speaker  5:40  
Now, okay. Now, okay, basically.
