is uh 26 of uh Sunday the 10th of October. So basically I got this here. Okay. Yes. Uh so basically this is the lightning bolt operation. It's about my hypothesis for something called reliable phenomena which phenomen like you know uh the lightning is like you know when you have like a floating war or light of lightning bol and you and you goes around the around and uh this is um based on my uh business access for business access. So like you know you know if you go to ob.org Um you see the the directed civility evolution uh assembly language which we try to make first for the uh architecture um gives from the contra system between the fossil and the plant which is like fossil and micros that gives you plant life example uh which is like 100% coherence lossless algorithms. Uh now uh further so basically uh the hypothesis my one try to uh stand up because I see that application like uh using analog systems uh are there but they are incoherent naturally uh but you know they are business signals so that's why the could be misinterpreted uh but you know they mean cohesive because it's not like up down up down uh if you sine wave uh you get a function coine function time function but you know the thing about systems so it's about like a universal computility like you know it's more about the ball uh than the predict but you know if I have a classical computer is it anal is it but they the things about them they single do computation but they work with different uh systems normal systems um but that's not really the go the go for the lightable which is for the system. If you go to business um BNB that's tier 3 A and B. So basically my business model is this. Um so uh the first tier is um let me first say T1 So tier one is open access uh access open access means open source uh access means machine development alignment for just um uh you get open sense like sensor development the same senses based on sensility touch things that uh like you know to interact with active systems know etc. Uh but that's explained before. Then tier two is business I said that's buying a computer buying a classical direct instruction or these system they can use this code pad everything you got like um T3A or T3 which is like if you get to you are really knowledgeable and you can really compare business get anyway publication and you one three five project uh one state that you want one year project three think of it like GCSE GCSE uh when I was at age 10. Okay. I get GCSE. Uh I got my GCSE. I do my stats. I passed that. I I passed the big test 100%. Uh my was 100%. Uh then I got um age 11 age 11. So basically you need to be there as a child. Basically protect you or your position to be there. So you're going to be at the center if you're a child. Uh of 90% I was 1% that's you know people smart when I came to first school into my SAT paper I passed it 100% I couldn't go to school then I uh I couldn't do my uh then I got uh T3 which means knowledge you got a kings king Access power T3 A T3 get together but you know you just follow the business model get our house once Three years three years you can get uh three years time you can get a diploma diploma after GCC foundation foundation diploma which have bachel ID for people who is not really know how to deal with lawyers go for one year next year uh will be for 1000 of PhD then I'll be 2000 for me of my PhD [ __ ] but I don't want to get my master that's what I'm saying so um okay back to okay so basically the goal of you guys is to prodate below um on my description. Okay, so the line so um basically the lion uh it's like you know yes this. So, so this is the light in project. So, okay again like happens when there's a gas uh and it causes a unifor distribution of potential energy and normalized uh uh uh potential energy inside the area and uh normalized potential energy and then within the area will be the distributed. No. So you go uniform uniform and you got normalized potential energy ratio. So basically my hypothesis is saying that same. So basically I'm saying that when basically I'm saying that basically my name the line the gas that happens when there is an um distribution which I call uniform like gravity is uniform but you know you don't feel gravity when you feel the you know you sense it but you feel it sense it but you know you can't sense this uniform The units is like potential energy the potential energy like the energy of falling. It's not connected on you know it does pass on but the potential energy of the cloud is like in the area and that inequality is really the energy but you know the kinetic energy is kinetic energy the kinetic energy just um the lightning the lightning Basically the uniform base around the area surface gas doesn't need And the gas can't escape because it's part of the structure because it's keeping it together. It's part of the system and that's why it's called exist. So the natural phenomenon I believe so high. So basically so basically the dust uh the dust collect from diversity of biomes like rural um desert uh rain when it rains and gathers into the atmosphere and the atmosphere collected up and it bubbles open to the atmosphere and then get a pattern you know you know human biome that's doing it that's doing it so it's regular so I'm saying because the pattern doesn't add up then regular pattern and then that uh that and then normalize to become the the shape of the clouds and the clouds then have static energy which is potential static energy like just discharge but you know everything has static energy in it if it has the field to hold it like you know you know energy just you know that's why you don't really feel it gravity you can't feel gravity anything has Normalization just spread out spread out the space whatever doesn't matter discharge discharge there's no just one direction of that force. Uh so basically yes so basically the polarization of potential energy. Uh so basically this is not for like a field force field. Uh let me let me just like come back to this. So this is broken. Uh this is not my normal pattern by the way. You can't see it. So basic [Music] basically this is a very funny bas the quantum field I model that you know quantum fields all quantum field have their own classical system too but I'll come back to that so the phase through objects there's no it's called plasma plasma plasma is naturally decodable once plasma has a field system any kind of biome force plasma energy. This what we call nuclear reactors. Plasma energy is like [Music] the natural nuclear reactor [Music] but plasma plasma scientific. So the normalization of the system is kind of uniform distribution [Music] everything. So let me uh my model of my I state that force equals mass acceleration. Uh that means like uh uh force acting objectals force rest force you know you can't objective force you know for every time you push system now for either system that's that's causing that change or something but doesn't need to be uh but essenti invest so we we live in a positron world [Music] electron world sorry uh electron world live in a negative world. Negative world. Uh so let me give you an example. So we uh in my model so for every force mass force force force means like there's an energy force energy that's causing that force. So basically change change something but do it way uh so change apply it's like this. So we live in world because electron oh wait no no no world everything is positive. So if you want to charge an electric if positive charge on charge go back and the battery comes down. So if charging it's positive charge being concealed in a vacuum which seems like a vacuum it's like sealed in escape and change to stable. So this is the plasmid most plasma and now uh nuclear reactor stable isotopes because they have property to it but you know isotop isotope is like isotope. state to resolve a stateution for plasmation system because they are working You got the stable [Music] states that can basically because the electrons are naturally negative electrons compositive also positron. composite. So for them to move, we need to move I need to give myself positive charge positivity. Uh so we call the proton the neutral is positive the electro negative neutral. Now the frame we got the negative which is opposite of the negative then do opposite system. So basically if I want to pull so basically negatively so like pull away like pulling something away pushing away that's like the system away from the force I'm acting so basically my to pull away which is weird because you know system to justify that field that's active. So if I put an engine uh I can pull an engine where I'm facing and you know instead of pushing the ground I push away with this system the the stand system model and then we push away with this neutral model. Uh so so so you know no push away this um neutron model you know just opposite pull charge electrons pull away the whole drive. Uh then I did a cloaking. So basically um if you create this field the perfect uh field you can go like a light coming to be fully invisible after Uh so I want to put 100% so can see through it think of something there. So to do this, I polarize the first I could find like a like a thresh like some kind of bubble around the door and the light passes through and the red light system inside So like you know something like so like 01 bit [Music] of position states to one class [Music] really allows for the 100% because You can think about systemological state Q of systems. It's like machines. I'm saying [Music] the phone is uniform. So it goes in direction. It just drifts whe gas it drifts. Whatever the always the most cohes you know like things that you can understand system to a car that's in charge and stay there longer because that system Okay. Uh the position of glass of the plane that yeah clothing [Music] here [Music] So this basically object transparent transparent use it can be opaque like a light field like electromagnetic field electromag direction. will make the system light. You get like red orange [Music] indigos uh which is operation I J. So basically this model [Music] here got this one here like something called red lights but you know polarize like deolarize one of them you can get red This is how do you laser [Music] coherent coherent light? No, it's not it's not that great because you know it's not white just but it's not really it's not light but it's not right direction light the wave of down system doesn't want to have to system wave, microwave, infrared. So if you go to my tit.com and you go to my um Tik Tok [Music] system that's not deploying This computer here is computer system [Music] computer doesn't understand instruction when the Wind plasma here doesn't disapp plasmo plas. [Music] system [Music] like phasing need [Music] to be enough to stabilize. This is like hide itself to be angled and change the way You can get friends about This is a single single. [Music] Yes. Okay. And you get uniforms. fields and clouds. It's just [Music] energy doesn't apply. Yeah. to become a phone. So guys, That's expecting this video. So my social media, my YouTube channel and guys, [Music] thank you. Share that with us and we see you there. world. Let's build Let's build Let's build a new Let's build a new Let's build a new system. Let's build a new system for ourselves. You know, you are actually about Thank you. All right.
