Hello guys, welcome back to my YouTube channel. Okay. Uh today I want to um introduce a problem uh anti uh conscious development. Now this is why the trust really matters. It's not really about the problem. It's about what goal actually is. You know the system understands. Now a hypothesis is the best explanation for a phenomenon such as light or such as echo why things echo really know why things happen the way they do because no one really knows everything you know uh it could give up the concept by directional learning framework the balance started a new foundation education to uh cross reference two uh system two facts of information based on PP something I define as part now is like if space of a sub group in the domain is called spar space like like the area the the sub is spar if it's sub uh or something of inquiry Correct. Uh principle protocol is implemented as a protocol as PP.com OBI serves um for dynamic uh skill um modeling uh system. Now D the dynamic system to um uh bodiversity um uh dynamic skill system framework uh something local minimum and local properties function that works very well for a sustain system for locality and the local minimum It's based on PPization and the information the component uh in based on the consumer observer of observing observable world and the um observable world around it uh surrounded state. coherence uh which is difficult for coherence operators tested uh uh auto component solutions uh unit test integration test and um uh system test uh the main goal of this P framework uh for the model uh something that I would call um something I define as uh uh precon preconcious neurodyiversity uh uh for anti systems. Um you know the goal of systems is not all systems are actually fragile you know don't know what they're doing uh to observe and consumer pattern uh as the infrastructure silicon uh today but you know this more expansive direct infrastructure system or direct information system the goal is this systems must know what to do ahead of time before they make the decision and this problem is that the problem of preconcious as well. Now people abilities uh I have a good preconcious uh vortex uh but the I'm going to give you the whole uh the broader outlook uh plusification for the horizontation for plasma systems. Now platform system prioritizes low minimum uh local maximum as a threshold uh for sparse analysis. Uh an example I'll give you is the for antiigation uh is the system to intentionally uh fragment the system to make it better as it evolve. the that's not the goal of that normal. So I'm gonna give you my example for me. I was watching the world a child. I knew everything but I knew ahead of time as I was in my head in my room I was aware of my surrounding but my mom wasn't before me but the information was not really being in my mom's room it was being also around the not I didn't feel like internally like what my brain can consume you know feel that cognition plasma system don't interact with the conraint they own system that isolate you can yeah stop and start as well because they used uh a standalone parameters to persist in that environment like uh if you find that the coherence of light that um is my system but can coherent uh coherence my goal today uh uh perhaps perceptional memory or what I like the uh uh the bubble conscious model. Now the system model is really relationship of that how the system holds together. But the pre uh position membrane is the uh phenotype is where the phenotype develops. It's where rose into a fetus. So basically I'm stating this model of a social bubble consciousness is to pop up that bubble. You have to pop up that bubble always. But that bubble serves as a ring or like a bubble to um to to conscious conraint. It reminds me of Nigeri high and I counter then I fall down. Now in that analogy the bubble is never destroyed. It becomes stronger. You know, every time it becomes stronger to a position of um good to a great way of um of doing something, you know, good new foundation, the new structure for the genotype and the feeling person the structure of the system uh cognitive bias and cognition, you No, no. I'm saying that the person is really not a personal rule that allows everyone to see that the outside world fully with no barrier with no barrier. The concept of the membrane is really because I can see everything start questions about it. I'm pure but that curiosity flows to my conscious and I observe it and process it without the external threat of that frame of reference for example someone me and say hey I'm joking with you I'm joking with you I'm going to shoot you back and I call the police and then the person say I will be jeopardized to my friend and I system. One thing to the power of this frame of lies in the perceptual memory concept and the relationship between you and I. For example, I can I can I can I can I can you know And um u the um uh basically here uh a diagram of a biome [Music] of my basically I can sorry guys anyway but Um it's kind of I want you to look at it. Uh but I can't find it here. So let's go example. So I can say to you that um someone for a proper framework for memory so for that system like framework or other things that people can exploit in human and documented as specifications of of the religious system. So for the people developing people to ensure that people are accounted for at all angles of everything because the problem is we are we do our best especially when it comes to people support the the the uh uh like I see for me for me personally this concept of two function step by step as derivative if it is this problem you know share or shared problem solutions can offer two solutions to solve that one problem set a perception of a bubble that allows me to see the world in the way. I start expressing the relate to the system without maintaining the environment in mind but the position is the smellus. No analogy. I had a friend who he was um nine years old. Uh I was um five years old. I just five. Uh he was touchs [Music] electric when you know for me [Music] it's just no regular head to timing is different and this pattern of authentic What's this one? This was mythm whether it's because of focus the high experience in that state of mind cannot be destructive. The goal of this framework is to push the limit of perception as in coherence. So when the system doesn'tffect affecting the whole ecosystem of the mind and system now [Music] uh nuts no nut has Uh like you know under rock [Music] sorry basically my friend which is why we have antiation for the system. Now my friendet. Okay. Sorry. Sorry guys. that there rock on the floor and then the car and take a rock and smash it on the nut. Where's the coconut? This is coconut. No, no. Uh the first [Music] thing open the phenotype the future today you saw it now the foundation of accessution is based on your biodiversity I can take my hand right now to take a coash a burden to prove my height and lost you know frustrated that's why I believe that's why I know I know uh the directution don't remember the model the power of the membrane system memory interpretation the information around the vast system of information. Um yes um the uh one thing it's not equality but they are different entities different and they are different uh it's not really the same conclusion for the biological system a better way for the sol is to join something called uh to join something called contract. to solve problems. mutual relationship between the two parties. the the monkey leopard. Nobody really in the in the individual uh uh consciousness. uh consciousness is fully subtractive is just it doesn't process information doesn't think about being unconsciousware do you know you want to be doing the job without thinking you're doing And that's what YouTube road. One thing to you is that uh the the the relationship between the uh intuition is to all consciousness models based on the conclusions. You know the goal of this uh this for principles and the four biological needs basic of of species really depends on the characteristics of that uh of the species of the species good model you know and uh this is on the precaut and how to uh basically have at the pre the pre the pre level actually start using your cognitive abilities to um attain some tasks. The goal of the artist is not a speech but a structure like who is this person? Who is this identity? what are they capable of and how they are able to do ABC the the you know I want to basically biology uh basically there's just one thing I want to add the bio framework uh is really based on the system of alkaline and static static skills a static scale so it's a static scale is 0 to 14 1 to 14 P I really I don't know the way but you know the the fact I'm saying to you that the statistical is not good enough to model the biodiversity. There's a mismatch between what can be in one domain in a water and what can be in a in a clean water because does not enforce the the new kind of biological thing that can happen in a in a system. The duality have something called a dynamic skill that takes into account new fundamental features of an ecosystem such as fox and budget and how things work in an example I'll give you of a diversity skill is in this framework is biodiversity we will have different animals here also man but if if they can't survive in other biomes such as can't survive in the code or in the uh hor survive in the wild but have in the uh in the where camels can survive for a day. You know, there's no point of a biodiversity have been in that biome for them because they just go in and they just gone back and there's no point because they don't allow the explosions to their own problems. One is grass cuz a horse can eat a horse can eat grass all day, but and a camel can eat drink water and eat cactus all day. But these are the same things in different biomes. you know uh but they are in different forms because then the horse has to say okay do I want a cactus slay I want a cactus yes let me go to a biome where I can get a cactus or the count can say let me go to a reservoir let me find a reservoir to get some more water you know cuz see these are different banks that interact and then show that they they work together you know cuz you don't know the unpredict stability of the nature your of the biome you're in. And that's why migration is a concept for animal as as they as it go evolve. Migration isn't really about um the moving of find a girlfriend even. It's about uh sustainability of the ecosystem you're already in. Can I stay in A? Can I go to this place B and come back at this time uh uh uh between A and B? uh uh PM can I do ABC the migration should be integrated to the anti-coercion and all the other D mitigation that people used to ensure that neurody divergent people can navigate to as they evolve as the question evolve and we find out how uh how the how um how they are really um how intuition really plays into human cognition and consciousness which I defined are subtractive. Now conscious is naturally subtractive again because this light bulb is 40 40 to 5 45 words a day a day uses that no an hour 45 to 45 an hour every 60 minutes but our consciousness my brain if I eat for one day and I eat well and I'm not hungry for the whole day my brain uses only to 60 60 to 65 watts of energy or jewels now compare that to the light bulb that's That's consciousness in action. That's me not having to go too far. That's me having to just focus and do everything myself, you know, cuz consciousness just solves that fragmented problem. It's an optimizer and allows you to do many things without knowing you are really um doing it cuz you if you're working if you're living and you're just working as you don't really you're conscious you just having you're having a bunch you don't have a problem with working cuz you're not you're not concerned with anything else and that's what um the anti-coercion and uh frameworks and all the uh precaution law uh the personal membrane is meant to allow uh uh uh system to uh evolve um and not fragmented based on brain computing interfaces. Uh thank you. Uh go to github.com/obi nexus breakbi uh github.com/obex bankruptcy which I've declined uh and follow me on my social media Tik Tok. Uh go to YouTube and find a more link uh for conituity. Uh um I hope this video you hope you guys um um like this video and try to uh and try to um uh create a a safe space a perceptual member for your kids and your future so they can develop with the um with what's happening around the world and able to navigate it too. I want you guys to use this framework and implement your delivering. You know, do do not try to block your children from the internet. Get access anyway, but guide them to use the systems already but safely. Thank you. Or play games with them anyway you want. Uh uh play nice games with people with them because they're
