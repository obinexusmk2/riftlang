Welcome back to my channel. So guys, you probably uh uh working on your spark guys, you know, I'm 
going to ask you, but you know, I'm agility. I have dyslexia. I don't have 
psychosis, but I haveis. So basically, I'm looking at the system right now. 
I'm thinking like uh EEGs obviously brain computer uh obcis um the thing 
about this is really understand how all the cooperate all the all 
the all the neurons in our brains how map out and growth how we uh uh store uh 
everything you understand how how this works uh but we don't understand the big 
full picture that makes the brain   you know our brain is like very powerful 
it's like apart from trying to quantum but not it's you know conscious so we're not 
computing consciousness you know we don't   consious the whole time you know what I'm 
saying I'm going to be aware to be aware you know you know I'm not watching the state of 
the state around me but think I'm conscious or be aware of myself being in the state of being 
aware which is about uh you know my work on is about consciousness the role the talk the 
person the ability, the intelligence intelligence uh like smart air infrastructure, smart house, 
smart car, smart stuff, things that are into smart hospitals, smart buses, smart trains, uh smart 
homes. Uh which is really what I'm about. Uh but why the BCI system? Why? Uh so this this goes 
all back to my aura seal analogy. Uh basically the aura seal is very essential to me. can find 
it. Um, uh, can I put it up? Can I show here? Uh, but let me try to get it on this picture on 
this slide. Uh, I'm sure I should be able to, um, put it up. Um, right now, um, I'm going 
to be straight up to you guys. You're going to love. If you do, then you know what I really 
mean. Uh how to initiative? Give me one second. Okay. This is just this is a very beautiful 
energy. This is what I'm about. You know, the healing the history, the journey I'm going 
through to become realign with myself the state of being the state of me will be next to Nambi 
becoming who I am you know it's not one second let me just try to so this one should be this 
is on top should be down this should not be down up should be should be not locked. Sorry. This should 
be fully up should be the screen. Sorry. It's kind of weird. This image here is 
called Russio it's really my identity my identity anchor I call it it's what's called 
insignia like you know it's like it was birth from sorrow like a birth for my uh who I 
am this picture is like you know about to get an oath for systems if you see this you 
know you know you is a serious matter you know you know something that can affect 
people's life if it's a mistake you know traditional technology things that really matter 
in the real world you know whether it's telepathy   or something so basically I'll just try to 
read out to you now this image is the first image of it kind of in Satan sign but you my 
face station it's like birth from something it's a new and that's the T3A and T3B access the 
most safety critical infrastructure system but this is for that need of uh for example I can 
see uh uh uh let me see if I can get it tutori before is uh tutorial. November. Um, sorry guys. Um, guys, I have something to do, but I can't leave this. I'm 
really trying to do something. Uh, Okay, I'll leave it there. I'll do 
something right now. Uh, sorry. Um, um, sorry. Um, sorry. You just see my um, 
okay, I'll leave that later. Okay. So, um, something just popped up. But, you 
know, uh, so this is a cell. This is like, uh, as a child, this a child here. I, uh, 
this, uh, sticky icon. I, uh, I journey, uh, Uh a reflection, a journey along a path as 
a child. A reflection, a journey along a path uh a reflection of me who I am to become an 
adult as an adult statement there with the ID. I return back a king to and this is just it's not   in the middle. It's just this lands 
all but based on the uh public key. It's not about today actually it's about uh 
safety control systems like what is actually belie individual especially especially nonverbal 
ones who can't speak or talk the the problem I'm facing with them is there's a there's a 
barrier between people who can speak extremely religion you know you say you 
have one degree of say I have a um there's there's a there's a clerative 
of one degree cousin and aunt and they have intercourse they have child that child 
becomes what the autistic or extreme has messed up their neuro abilities abilities 
or so they say but that's not what I'm going for so that's why experience. It's 
about healing situation. You know, I lost that nonverbal, you know, walk 
struggle because you can't have the the scenario. I won't get by 
just talking to the the out to you is you know for me my autism is really 
about me myself and I you know it's about my self who is why does he think the way he 
does what does he do it's not about the world around me I don't care about the world I care 
about that's what I care about getting stuff It doesn't matter if adult know 
the goal is just to get PhD uh good life project life work you know and have 
sustainability uh the thing about micro diver How chart the phenotypes show whether the out of the gen the shape of the throat the 
click on the fingers you know the cl of the hands you know it's a pattern but it's not a bad thing 
for me for me it's about to risk all these toys I see they're just behind me you know I can click my 
fingers but the stress in my mind it's not because I'm stressed it's because I want to show the like 
me but you know I want you feeling I'm not I'm yes but for me it's not really the issue it's the 
for example it's not really the issue it's the problem in my head the computation I'm doing 
that's the issue for me for me it seems hard to explain to you but it's kindical it's kind of 
should I would I do I or is it more like very hard questions philosophically for now to go straight 
around you know whether navigating the brokers of friends and uh observing the state of mind 
of my consciousness or watching my own thoughts and trying to break up heart without doing it. Uh 
for me what this really means is I'm going to say twice is thinking about my brain uh thinking 
about it with a hammer on it and just recent how this component work is you know me me who 
is who Who is it? Uh um basic uh uh me myself. Am I myself? Am I making the right decision? Am 
I doing the right way? Uh who am I? Me, myself, and I. Who am I? I am a I am. I'm obsessive. 
The goal of this project is really to understand inner workings of neurody divergence at 
the maximum. You know, you know child of diverence like something mathematical 
computing that we know that cousins and aunts have intercourse and they have someone that can speak 
and what that means for that individual on the   spectrum on the on the graph of the field of uh 
having the most severity of the diabetes based on diamond dependency and genotype or phenotype model 
of I like to say the 100 to 200 spark neurosical spark is not neurotypical. It doesn't really mean 
you're either because we don't know. But the new spark is the spark that most individual people 
most if not all experience. For me, I experienced this for me when high you know I'm in the zone but 
the z broken broken the mill. Uh I can get to it easily. I can I can more get this one something 
you know. Uh That's like a computation of that, you know, it's like warming up in your head but 
faster. You know, that's how I put it. You know,   the children want to play basketball. I don't 
have to warm up for basketball. I could just think I played basketball and imagine all the 
moves of the basketball and that you know for me I cleared that but you know um people that 
have autism should come and say their own word. Uh for me it's like it's navigating the system. 
being you know you know how when I'm playing I get flaws victory whether I'm playing I get I get 
beat down uh 63 fighter I get back up but you know the goal is like not rewiring restructuring 
the system you know stop learn to adapt and survive the the previous and navigate the 
more systems that are multiples and robots as well as play um m opponents physically 
uh harass them over the thing. So this um project spark you know reminds me of me 
being pages of people talking about my needs of independent housing and going back to foster 
care. The problem I had with them was that I was   in my position for a year in I never got a house. 
came out 16 years old by law uh under council me just go in uh there's two double doors if 
you double door uh first double door and you go left and right girls if you go to the 
right girls you get all the girls at every angle there's a double door and that's insane. 
There's no really care there. the people there are already not sick but you know like I was saying 
the more you get worse and worse because the less they do the job the more they get paid you know 
less because you know the longer they keep you or can't keep you the more you get paid you know 
this kind of anti you know the goal is not respit I like I say UFO the UFO was not real. I made up 
I said it was it could be helicopter I didn't see anything you know I said on fire object uh 
to psychologist one 45 minutes meant to be uh 60 minutes a golden hour five minutes 
which is a golden hour in psychology by two independent psychologist who don't 
work together to say this person crazy   I just for one less than a minute was it 0.5 
seconds 0.5 seconds I don't know 30 seconds Council, you know, also team that the problem 
really is the the backwards of the technology, the backwards of the system and how 
people want to treat each other problem. They want to see the benefit of this 
of the wanting people who are divers and they leave them in the flats and they pay 
the price. They know they're in boxes, yes,   but not sustainable and They end up perpetrating 
cycle of oppression and oppression that that that put them in that system and they don't call them 
bad man or bad person. But the system wasn't built around them in the first place. No one went up 
to someone and said, "Hey, um, can I hear your medication?" No one asks me just take 
medication, take medication or oh you go to um the kind of violence that happens in that 
place is it's stressful it's just stressful it's insulting the whole entire industry it's 
the 2014 at uh how the system was to do uh the people that have done capacity that do just uh 
fit the mold or want to fit the mold that the to uh uh work with because they are neurody divergent 
but they have different needs. Um it's disgusting because they want to actually um be praised for 
doing a lack of work and um keeping my brother just playing catch 22 with my human life as 
it was a human being. uh the staff meiction. Uh I just came here one year out my food. As you 
know in a public bathroom uh from 2015 to 16 in the public space shower in my room and I had no 
excuse to my boy and stuff you can't lie about all of that but the fact of the matter is they 
don't care they don't want to care you know say there was no children you at any hospital you 
said saw a UFO and that was it You know that's why I'm doing it's not because they are they don't 
want to do their job according to what they set out you know because they want to keep harassing 
people you know in north in Kent you know the pain was that the worst thing worst part of what 
was that I saw someone go oh my god oh sorry Why? So I saw you know nothing about this 
person but I didn't know I think it was speak but now 2015 the fact there's cultural dynamics 
everywhere and you know they lie and post all the stories of whatever they said and I lied for 
a house not and I lied for a house my friend house you know I didn't want to cond anything 
you know for me it's not about questioning   these people you know holding them accountable 
individ all sort of sto I'm hearing a system that keep there accountable you know the lack 
of regulation lack of chase up the lack of people that investigate for children you know 
I'll be sign up for you know I knew it was the same thing in Nigeria the kind of uh the woman uh 
when child uh the woman was just um the was like child and death down died and um uh the pro 
and then this woman sweeping the child my understanding of how the fact 
of the matter is this person should get a better you know we don't we don't 
know people that are don't see schools afraid of how treated uh by their peers and they go to marks 
just to just to just to show that's not theirs uh more specifically me I don't want I 
don't want I want to do my own thing I ABC you know I don't want to be what they 
want me to be you know I want to be myself for what is it to be I became you know remove 
the marks preserve the system of the spoid uh rise you know that's the poem I was going to 
do for you guys and this like a like a sign so it's like an end signification of and self 
of self preservation so this like rise of return of the watches of uh like that as well. 
But that's one way you can play for the poem. Uh but I'm saying to it's not because 
they don't want to do anything or for I don't want I'm just saying I can make decision. So the authentic like one actually uh people works in two ways my first You know my birectionally 
because you know let me make an uh people first of all there's no 
post no post just action people can't uh uh have no just the action of 
that thing. There's no association with that action. There's no 
pattern. action. This is very sensory. You know, say I want to 
go to the shop. Let's just come back and give you a milk. I think I bought milk of dair the fridge all the four edges the 
brown the milk and the pack and then the using that to get it to shop 
like ora or or milk, you know. Uh, last itself, not so. Hey, that's me. Hey, today we want to get some change. 65 this uh milk and I go to 
the shop and buy this pack myself a lot nothing and the path should be like don't for three and 
then the action you know this is what you know I'm saying I believe that consciousness consciousness is that I know using power. So be aware is the code 
structure. into itself. It's like uh have 45 40 system imperial system but that's wrong 665 and the brain is conscious mind 
6465 per day. No, sorry. Sorry. No, no, no, no. 425 per hour per hour. per hour to 
consume per hour per hour for the Libr to consume calories for the whole 
day just to think like this you know the model because you know you 
can't tell someone to do something and determine what is you know that kind of 
processes really undermines it and conceptual understanding is that affect but you based on the direct symbol you know for me this 
is to me as a result because it's not just a prediction to me it's mecious on my birth who I am 
why I am to be why I am doing what I'm doing now so basically so I sight Um sight uh no smell uh touch sight uh yes hear touch Hearing all sense and smell taste taste taste like you know like I feel extra like a chrome color placeholder color. You know that's sign 
place of color. There's nothing there's nothing there because red and green uh is but 
you can't make on paper with just that mixture because it's not in the field of view of the 
electron just you don't see you know cuz the uh the red cones and the blue cones of the 
eyes are just saving space which happens pieces coming into my world. What I'm saying to you 
is we have all of you have a rich world view like for me I personally know this frozen time basically. This is crack. This is to me. It's not enough to show my 
tattoo. I want to have my haircut. That's my soul. identity man who is the uh uh via the protocol. Now the protocol is 
kind of blow your mind but I want you to understand it's very simple 
to understand. So just person of the person has an oh this is you know and then anchor the 
reflection of that person that to say hold up, you know, and not get rid of it, you know, and 
then they feed a child like a spoon or a spoon, a spoon of punch, but you know, you don't 
punch and feed the puppet and you feed them. You know that kind of way you can learn to free 
themselves you know because they have an anchor which is the puppet of the persona of that 
state of mind. They don't need to coers the puppets in any way or form and that's trying 
to protect them in a way that's authentic. They want to understand they have rights 
to uh grow space to operate and shape the world view free of anybody the so the 
system doesn't really work for that people ABC uh I was you know uh yes okay uh so 
for what I say basically when I was born uh that concept when I was born I su as soon 
as it was just popped into existence like pop and then and wasn't explosion but it was 
an explosion was implo it wasn't like an explosion from it was like explosion for my dot 
and my formed and I and you know it formed and my brain started sh I knew I was conscious because 
I consciousness but I don't know. I think about me embryo and my womb. I know I'm conscious 
because I was born. I see nothing and and I know I'm conscious. I can go 
outside of my conscious zones.   I can uh look up to read up uh things that 
people human history uh if I wanted to but you know I had to have a anchor to myself 
because for example I can journey in my   mind to see what's outside mind because my let me 
do that it sounds kind of weird but it is there so I'm saying to you the consciousness is 
like that you know can be the preconcious   state you know state of being aware without 
being knowing you're aware you know that's saying you're aware but you don't know 
you're aware so you are being operated   that you're being bushed as well but you don't 
know you're being you don't know you don't know you know the system allows you to do that you 
know preconidence the preconiousness is that you know it's possible to um to someone 
that's preconcious and feel pain in that because they they they don't do not have 
the awareness to or stimul the the system tracking that awareness state because they 
asleep you know before you can go like a straight line you can go a straight line uh Um there you know you know me what is this why is this important so confused 
what's uh the system I know everything at time I just didn't take everything. 
So I just everything I didn't think it was important to hold 
on to people directly the system you can um I'm going to artifact the mind you 
know to me uh I can search everything that was to search the thing that 
was there was searchable findable But you know the focus on what I really 
wanted to do but I didn't focus on myself to walk you know to walk you know you 
don't just take a car that's saying the consciousness was there for me but it wasn't 
um it wasn't uh because I wasn't conscious They didn't know I was conscious. Uh to my consciousness, yes, but I didn't have uh I 
was being loaded up into the world the simulation space from the 13 uh 36 and 69 uh you know uh about something called um you 
know the thing is aboutology condition you know just awareness which is way 
of doing We don't know how to do it because the kind of fl and off and you know trying to uh direct 
you know flicker flicker flash and the filter flashing and flicker one you know like 
I flicker don't just uh flicker I flicker and I which calling the flicker model more authentic 
model for robot filter flash you know that's when you actually post conscious so the flickering is 
just a quick swing off but because it's just it's so subractive doesn't want to use any energy 
just focus on and off you know uh you know You know, for me, I feel that 
everything, you know, and then my mom was around and he was born 
there. There was a lady there outside uh outside my room. There's a 
door at the back here and you can get   um the the walls here. There's a doctor There's a doctor's door there just opposite 
me and there's like another door behind you.   You come to this room. You go. This is mom's 
bed. This is my mom's bed. This is my bed. Uh and she put me down on the cradle and you 
know uh and she carried me for a little while   and then she put me down. I had awareness of 
that consciousness because uh consciousness was still in my consciousness. I didn't sound 
crazy and I had a Chinese dragon. The first Oh, come on. Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Um, this is the first uh in sign which I swing for you guys. That was the one that 
journeyed you know he journey Japan every day just myself you know it was a Japanese I was four four years old actually talking about the the so much. I was in grave that was Japanese 
culture. Who is this Japanese dragon you know uh culture? I was in a you know mommy water 
culture spirit water you know how do people have consciousness how do you navigate um the man 
or woman who who's identity the soul of uh which as who are who is he you know and navigating 
yourself you know just to make some sense some clarity of what's happening around you know but 
you know for me it was highly about philosophical uh the journey and the depth of my journey romance 
love uh uh family. Uh it wasn't emotional, it was just highly philosophical. Um you know uh uh it 
reminds me of just bootstropping consciousness for produces own problems. Uh which is kind of funny 
if you think of it cuz you know a program you know that own problem is uh for you know it needs 
to fix itself before it does. So um I've been working on uh uh you know but you know quick flash 
and quick filter uh all by direction components. It can quick flash something or you can quick 
filter something. can quick something quick flu allows cautious to evolve uh and allows the 
uh you the entity to stay aligned with your uh with your uh biological soul or your ecosystem 
who where you're from you know uh this oral cell is very important to me and how's always been okay 
uh anything else I discuss oh yes the relay system okay so the wheel system is just a puppet um 
relaying information when the autonic child be I think oh yes let me example where is it um I think 
I'll stop this video now yes uh let me stop it now okay let me just get it so the relay system very 
important so this do here system is this uh so um today uh Yes. Shitty head. Shitty head. Shitty head. So um so this is all it's very powerful. So this is like the system. Uh did you 
shout today? Uh uh no look left right uh but you know this is broken down you know 
in a way I just pause you know for reason to have the person to understand the reinforcement 
layer of the person you This is a binary question, you know, really because in a in 
a in a state of um severe anxiety, but this is a simple way for the 
same thing. I can I can question uh then ask this question. Uh if you shop today, 
uh did you have practice and replies um same ass question to a person like um like this um uh like this uh like this uh oh so 
basically a seasonal kind of move um But the mother does this. So the child had 
a color uh red, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. And the child must paint uh the uh the 
fishes in the ocean. Uh and you know, she sees a blue well, you know. So blue is blue. And he 
said, "Yes, blue, blue. Pick blue." understand indigo and say no indigen she picks your violet violet no take 
away and then she picks blue she instead from the release of you doing 
that you know was very important you No question is classified as someone to 
do something they want to do you know and assist them authentically you know 
classified it's like a true or false   you know classifier to ensure authentic 
behavior as a whole protocol you know three to have insight they can read the 
system. This person is getting better. Alexa fragmented system understandable fragmented system which is like you know who don't know each other. 
You know the mind doesn't know it's there. It's still because you're stuck. It's stuck in limo and 
you know it's like there's no there's no direction to tell them okay wake up wake up. It's kind of 
weird but it doesn't you it's what I believe is really happening the pre and then let's see. 
So you now have like a a preconcious state uh human now uh uh how basically when they have 
correct and they continue that way and they do completed to ensure this is a photocol people 
that are working don't leave you know getting better in your mind you know just mention the way 
to do your job that's probably one game theory so it's more philological in a social 
understanding you know who is this person going to be uh how does this person 
travel to the surrounding you know the goal is to go to six for these kids to uh just to 
really interact and be themselves with their own you know socialize however they want 
to do. So uh of course um how they want to do how guided regard to everyone equity 
uh and you know we don't want anybody coming after they get better something get 
wrong in the process of getting better focus divergence the uh computer relay interface,   you know, cuz the relay is like a single 
and then relaying to us, not even them, you know, and what we need to do and you can 
relay back to them if we have to give away to   talk to them because we don't understand the 
world and that's what I'm seeing fragmented, you know, it's like me myself uh because there's 
some uh something I didn't really understand about my own state of mind, state of being, you 
know, the full circle of not only actual work solution. Uh uh reduction uh dimension three. 
Uh okay. One more thing. Okay. Uh okay. Uh no no one. Okay. Okay. Basically this is symbiotic 
evolution. Uh this just means what if the compiler every man who begins with an or script stand 
of cross shared between two contributation in cells become get off. signals and time the 
first type of meaning appears. Uh but this called direct symbical evolution but this is like a thing 
uh this is the womb is a living interpreter. So basically the wound is your shift consciousness 
you know interpret your state of being maybe the come from the womb. Uh but you know this is 
a two car say this is my formulation you know   uh you know 32 is an odd number but it goes 1 2 3 
gives me 46 is an even number but the but this is this is a prime number you know it's a prime 
mutation so that you have a variety individ uh reduce life every uh uh this 46 most people   uh on and off the roo system isn't in gradients 
resolves not as zero but as 1012 where the state hold on such a delay and potential you know 
this is about like um having an imbalance you know this like towards a shared 
language this is direct DC birth control   um uh basically this project is like you 
know this is something else but it's like uh it's called directed uh uh directed um directed 
uh active symbiotic birth control. Uh this uh this is something for one child policy in China. 
Uh but I I just shifted the guess because you   know uh the man is woman is if you don't know 
women are before you anyone man they're woman and the woman is the first step. Why? Because the 
generational woman when women survive uh the women get stressed they get women you know and women 
are easier to make sier than men because they are the first between and having a woman first is 
more easy to get because a woman has a womb and they can carry the generation forward after a set 
of interactions with another. Uh but uh someone can um get pregnant you know for a man is a man 
with a w that's w you know there's no definition you know a woman without so has an embryo a 
fetus to have a birth and that's a womb man uh uh basically the life work first uh this like 
uh the life system I this like topology for you go to me uh this is build your own so this is 
this like or to heal the left behind I basically reinstitution I will not become also to break me 
I'll build what must heal us all to heal brother that's me uh rise my time is now our time 
is now fellowship ship new foundation for let's bless ourselves men our sour but that's 
what I'm saying life and work foundation track aspiration you know separation between foundation 
go food watering eating and aspiration if you don't if you can't meet aspiration needs uh 
wants or tracks needs or want you uh then back to the foundation your foundation go back a 
step it takes a step forward uh which is what I'm saying to you uh but this is the most hierarchy 
you know psychological um uh safety everything uh I'm watching this now so basically I'm saying 
to you this uh triangle is basically needs safety uh here and then the uh uh belonging 
love and needs and extreme needs and   the self relation selfment you know I can for 
this in the long term doesn't mean anything uh uh but that's what I'm saying today um you can 
read this article too. Uh but my time is running kind of running up. Uh and this is the uh BCR 
brain computer interface. Uh sorry put um this uh this is basically this is a 10year boy with 
severe autism and ASD nonverbal exhibiting a management of struggles to communication basically 
a need emotion. The child plays a secret to help   the child uh strong connection to himself. How 
does uh sleep uh with noninvasive uh EEG? The charge is light with a dry electrode designed 
to be part of the uh PDF P2. The headset surface EG uh focus and consciousness signals 200 pre or 
awareness window you know the singers not invasive requires this what I'm saying the therapist begins 
the uh really the protocol sensual feedback and tactile puppets research uh so you know the child 
in the puppets everything and the system then uh begins to fix itself because she knows the 
child is receiving inputs but we the child really need something especially when the child wants 
something but the of human cognition. You know   what's to do? uh being authentic a clean uh uh 
adjusting feedback movement uh uh foster sense of comfort overall the child become associate 
with the action for thinking about uh uh what uh the text you the puppet might but you know this 
is directly indirectly but um the directly with the indirectly will be um but you know the thing 
about this is have a feedback loop um for and the public to understand what's all within our minds 
you know uh within like for me I I have two sides to me which is I can go here very far you can 
go to Mars you know want to go to Mars you know Mars before and explore there you know or is here 
oh this is they align then you know because they kingship but they can We got to keep communication 
that's what mean you know must be aligned with something objective thinking about space travel 
here but you know if I don't have alignment and I forget and I get one side of me uh my foundation 
in ecos that damage I can degrade and get worse uh as I'm saying to you uh it's meant to uh 
provide you with prosperity They're trying to do this which is real divergence people. 
Uh that's the know to solve problems just by having a grasp not by intuition. By intuition 
by by all means because they know the deeper layers whether experience or not which is 
knowledge to do something because they know   how systems do work internally for themselves. 
uh the the person development. Oh yes. The PCR is like uh brain computing interface 
like um this G model like you can have that affect the feelings that make people look 
uh people look um neurodyiverent uh people uh ugly too. Uh but you know that's not what we 
want for them. We want them to look beautiful   the most persona for them. want them to look 
um uh uh authentic, have good lives, you know, we we want people to actually start healing, you 
know, and and not trauma from them, you know, uh for years, you know. For me, I want people to 
come out of their of the of their of their coma, their state of mind and then tell us what 
they experience and drive new generations.   You know that's what really wants for everyone is 
just don't even worry about the the breakthroughs all the research you know just oh what you 
experience when I done this to you at this time of day do you remember ABC uh when this 
happened to this guy when he uh when he fell down and the puppet he fell on his puppet and 
he rushed you know something like that something so people that use new diversion therapy aren't 
stuck in limbo having actually using pattern matching because pattern we can use pattern 
matching because uh you can use matching is birectional but you don't I don't really want to 
uh uh so you can have like a stream go one way and go like a consciousness way uh one thinking 
something now uh I'm trying to forget something to forget how something works but you know I 
forget everything cuz I don't have to call. So I'm thinking about foretting all the harassing 
but don't forget that I forget only the bad stuff only the good stuff cuz you know I want to keep 
the bad stuff cuz the the good stuff just think about the good stuff that happened and very 
minimal just try to think about it and then   think here forget the good stuff. Why? Good 
for doesn't push you forward. It doesn't let me identify the problem. Let me see my horror and 
uh one more thing. Uh so one more thing or seal guine the parrot guine is watching. Okay. Okay. 
So basically what this oral seal is a is really a friend of m you know guys you know please 
understand this. So basically this is like   uh as a child I uh journey through a tracks uh I 
journey through uh uh as a child uh this two uh uh I don't even child I journey uh uh through the 
land everything uh through broken systems through everything through reflection of myself uh of 
myself uh the reflection of what is reflection of knowledge and wisdom. You see this uh anchor I 
become an adult. As an adult, I journey backwards, you know, backwards. This is like the arrow 
backwards to return a king. a king like a king sign uh chart a king or something and then you 
know uh and then this like this middle line is the land is all m you know this what I'm saying 
the beauty of the framework is that it it encodes what we what we always suffered and we won't be 
able to uh come and build on top of what we done you know what the experience from me the concept 
classifier is the most important one of all you know if I can see this computer it's made up I 
can't define a metal. I don't know what metal is. Uh shiny shiny. But that's what I know of metal. 
Uh cuz it's like a holder. Oh, okay. Basically, this pen plastic plastic rubber rubber. I just 
say rubber, but it's a pen. It's made of rubber. It's made of these things. But I know it's a 
pen. Why? Because it has properties of a pen, which I call properties set. It has the the five 
touch of pen. I can push it up and down. I can twist it, pop it by the right hand, click up and 
down, etc. It's a writing equipment. It's a pen. But you know, the problem isn't the noise a pen. 
It's use a pen. It can be a pencil. You know, you know, this can be a mechanical pen. 
Pencil saying a pen. So I'm saying to you the thing about you know the classifier 
has to be aligned to that is yellow as well. I know it's a pen because the verb the verb is 
the doing word like you know fast rubber how hard to touch soft uh shaky uh pen like you 
know uh something that the verb noun so the verb is like a verb noun category d so basically 
do you have like a d you have like a something is a car let's just say example moving uh 
fast something fast uh uh moving uh running uh Running wheel. Running wheel. A running wheel 
can be uh uh uh something uh you know and then uh rubber wheel. These are two running rubber 
rubber wheel. These are two uh dags. You see these are classifiers for wheel actually. But we 
know what a car or truck you know you know this is a dag cuz you know the go classification is 
to have like some kind of blueprint. This is a dag model. You can classify stuff uh for them. 
You see I see this I act on this. This is this for that person. Uh guys uh I wish you 
all the best and I love you too. Uh, take care and hope you minister.
