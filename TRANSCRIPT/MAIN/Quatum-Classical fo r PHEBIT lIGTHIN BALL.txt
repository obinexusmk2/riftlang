In this video, we explore plasmoid systems and how the lightning ball phenomenon can be used to investigate new energy systems as a byproduct of various dynamic interactions. These interactions transition coherence from classical systems to quantum systems with isomorphic isotropic topological relations. For such systems, RENT Money is only viable under X-ray graze waves in the world, alongside other systems like ROYGBI for electromagnetic fields or color spectrum fields. This interaction spans across field space via network laws and quantum field topological states, functioning as a semiotic contract.

s uh 26 of uh Sunday the 10th of October.
0:05
So basically I got this here. Okay. Yes.
0:11
Uh so basically this is the lightning bolt operation. It's about my hypothesis
0:16
for something called reliable phenomena which phenomen
0:36
like you know uh the lightning is like you know when you have like a floating war or light of lightning bol and you
0:43
and you goes around the around and uh this is um based on my uh
0:48
business access for business access. So like you know you know if you go to
0:54
ob.org Um you see the the directed civility evolution uh assembly language
1:00
which we try to make first for the uh architecture um gives from the contra
1:08
system between the fossil and the plant which is like fossil and micros that
1:14
gives you plant life example uh which is like 100%
1:20
coherence lossless algorithms. Uh now uh further so basically uh the
1:29
hypothesis my one try to uh stand up because I see that application like uh
1:34
using analog systems uh are there but they are incoherent naturally uh but you
1:40
know they are business signals so that's why the could be misinterpreted uh but you know they mean cohesive because it's
1:47
not like up down up down uh if you sine wave uh you get a function coine
1:52
function time function but you know the thing about systems so it's about like a universal computility like you know it's
1:58
more about the ball uh than the predict but you know if I have a classical
2:03
computer is it anal is it
2:09
but they the things about them they single do computation but they work with
2:15
different uh systems normal systems um but that's not really the go the go for
2:20
the lightable which is for the system. If you go to
2:28
business um BNB
2:39
that's tier 3 A and B. So basically my business model is this. Um so uh the
2:46
first tier is um let me first say T1 So tier one is open access uh access open
2:54
access means open source uh access means machine development alignment for just
2:59
um uh you get open sense like sensor development
3:06
the same senses based on sensility touch things that uh like you
3:14
know to interact with active systems know
3:21
etc. Uh but that's explained before. Then tier two is business I said that's
3:29
buying a computer buying a classical direct instruction
3:35
or these system they can use this code
3:45
pad everything you got like um T3A or T3 which is like
3:57
if you get to you are really knowledgeable and you can really compare business get anyway publication
4:09
and you one three five project uh one state that you want one year project
4:17
three think of it like GCSE GCSE uh when I was at age 10. Okay. I
4:26
get GCSE. Uh I got my GCSE. I do my stats. I passed that. I I passed the big
4:31
test 100%. Uh my was 100%. Uh then I got
4:38
um age 11 age 11. So basically you need to be there as a child. Basically
4:44
protect you or your position to be there. So you're going to be at the center if you're a
4:51
child. Uh of 90%
4:56
I was 1% that's you know people smart
5:02
when I came to first school into my SAT paper I passed it 100% I couldn't go to
5:10
school then I uh I couldn't do my uh then I got uh T3
5:17
which means knowledge you got a kings king Access
5:26
power
5:32
T3 A T3 get
5:40
together
5:46
but you know you just follow the business model get our house once Three years three years you can get uh three
5:54
years time you can get a diploma diploma
5:59
after GCC foundation foundation
6:05
diploma which have bachel
6:20
ID for people who is not really
6:26
know how to deal with lawyers
6:44
go for one year next year uh will be for 1000
6:50
of PhD then I'll be 2000 for me of my PhD
6:57
[ __ ] but I don't want to get my master that's what I'm saying so um okay back
7:03
to okay so basically the goal of you guys is to prodate
7:21
below um on my description. Okay, so the line so
7:28
um basically the lion uh it's like you know yes
7:48
this. So, so this is the light in project. So, okay again like happens
7:56
when there's a gas uh and it causes a unifor distribution of potential energy
8:02
and normalized uh uh
8:07
uh potential energy inside the area and uh normalized potential energy and then
8:14
within the area will be the distributed. No. So you go uniform uniform and you
8:20
got normalized potential energy ratio. So basically my hypothesis is saying
8:25
that same. So basically I'm saying that when
8:31
basically I'm saying that basically my name the line the gas that
8:39
happens when there is an um distribution which I call uniform like gravity is
8:45
uniform but you know you don't feel gravity when you feel the you know you sense it
8:52
but you feel it sense it but you know you can't sense this uniform
8:58
The units is like potential energy the potential energy like the energy of falling. It's not connected on you know
9:06
it does pass on but the potential energy of the cloud is
9:12
like in the area and that inequality is really the energy
9:18
but you know the kinetic energy is kinetic energy
9:23
the kinetic energy just um the lightning
9:31
the lightning Basically
9:36
the uniform
9:43
base around the area surface gas
9:59
doesn't need And the gas can't escape because it's
10:05
part of the structure because it's keeping it together. It's part of the system and that's why it's
10:11
called exist. So the natural phenomenon I believe so high. So basically
10:19
so basically the dust uh the dust collect from diversity of biomes like
10:25
rural um desert uh rain when it rains and gathers into the atmosphere and the
10:32
atmosphere collected up and it bubbles open to the atmosphere and then
10:38
get a pattern you know you know human
10:45
biome that's doing it that's doing it so it's regular so I'm
10:51
saying because the pattern doesn't add up then
10:58
regular pattern and then that uh that
11:03
and then normalize to become the the shape of the clouds and the clouds then
11:10
have static energy which is potential static energy like just
11:15
discharge but you know everything has static energy in it if it has the field to hold it like you know you know energy
11:23
just you know that's why you don't really feel it gravity you can't feel gravity
11:30
anything has Normalization
11:40
just spread out spread out the space whatever
11:46
doesn't matter
11:54
discharge discharge there's no just
12:00
one direction of that force. Uh so basically yes so basically the
12:06
polarization of potential energy. Uh
12:13
so basically this is not for like a field force field. Uh
12:20
let me let me just like come back to this.
12:26
So this is broken. Uh this is not my normal pattern by the way. You can't see
12:31
it. So
12:43
basic
12:50
[Music]
12:57
basically this is a very funny bas the quantum field I model that you
13:04
know quantum fields all quantum field have their own classical system too but
13:10
I'll come back to that so
13:16
the phase through objects there's no it's called plasma plasma
13:23
plasma is naturally decodable once plasma has a field
13:28
system any kind of biome force plasma energy. This what we call nuclear
13:34
reactors. Plasma energy is like [Music] the natural nuclear reactor
13:42
[Music] but plasma
13:48
plasma scientific. So the normalization of the system is
13:53
kind of uniform distribution
14:09
[Music]
14:15
everything. So let me uh my model of my
14:22
I state that force equals mass acceleration. Uh that means like uh uh
14:28
force acting objectals force
14:34
rest force you know you can't objective
14:41
force you know for every time you push system now for
14:50
either system that's that's causing that change
14:56
or something but doesn't need to be uh but essenti
15:08
invest so we we live in a positron world [Music]
15:15
electron world sorry uh electron world live in a negative
15:21
world. Negative world. Uh so let me give you an example. So we uh in my model
15:30
so for every force mass force force force means like there's an
15:37
energy force energy that's causing that force. So basically change change something but
15:47
do it way uh so change
15:52
apply it's like this. So we live in world because electron oh wait no no no
16:01
world everything is positive. So if you want to charge an electric if positive charge
16:10
on charge go back and the battery comes down. So if
16:16
charging it's positive charge being concealed in a vacuum which seems like a
16:21
vacuum it's like sealed in escape and change to
16:28
stable. So this is the plasmid most plasma and
16:35
now uh nuclear reactor
16:40
stable isotopes because they have property to it
16:48
but you know isotop
16:57
isotope is like isotope.
17:04
state to resolve a stateution for plasmation
17:12
system because they are
17:20
working
17:31
You got the stable
17:40
[Music] states that can
17:46
basically because the electrons are naturally
17:52
negative electrons
17:57
compositive also positron. composite. So for them to move, we need to move I need
18:03
to give myself positive charge positivity. Uh so we call the proton the
18:10
neutral is positive the electro negative neutral. Now
18:16
the frame we got the negative which is opposite of
18:21
the negative then do opposite system. So basically if I want to pull
18:28
so basically negatively so like pull away like
18:36
pulling something away pushing away that's like the system
18:48
away from the force I'm acting so basically my
18:58
to pull away which is weird because you know system to justify that field that's
19:04
active. So if I put an engine uh I can pull an engine where I'm facing
19:12
and you know instead of pushing the ground I push away with this system the
19:17
the stand system model and then we push away with this
19:22
neutral model. Uh so so so you know no push away this um neutron model
19:30
you know just opposite pull
19:35
charge electrons
19:46
pull away
19:54
the whole drive. Uh then I did a cloaking. So basically um if you create this field the perfect uh field
20:07
you can go like a light coming
20:25
to be fully invisible after Uh so I want to put 100% so can see
20:30
through it think of something there. So to do this, I polarize the first I could
20:38
find like a like a thresh like some kind of bubble around the door and the light
20:44
passes through and the red light system
20:57
inside
21:03
So like you know something
21:11
like so like 01
21:17
bit [Music] of
21:24
position states to one class [Music]
21:40
really allows for the 100% because
21:45
You can think about systemological state
21:53
Q
21:59
of systems. It's like
22:07
machines.
22:17
I'm saying
22:23
[Music] the phone is uniform. So it goes in direction.
22:34
It just drifts whe gas it drifts. Whatever the
22:40
always the most cohes you know like things that you can
22:46
understand system to a car
22:54
that's in charge and stay there longer because that
23:00
system Okay. Uh the position of glass
23:11
of the plane that yeah clothing
23:18
[Music] here
23:29
[Music] So this
23:37
basically object
23:43
transparent transparent use
23:53
it can be opaque like a light field like
23:59
electromagnetic field electromag
24:05
direction. will make the system
24:12
light. You get like
24:19
red orange
24:26
[Music] indigos
24:42
uh which is operation I J.
24:49
So basically this model [Music]
24:55
here
25:04
got this one here like something called red
25:13
lights but you know polarize like deolarize one of them you can get red
25:20
This is how do you laser
25:25
[Music] coherent coherent light? No, it's not
25:30
it's not that great because you know it's not white just
25:36
but it's not really it's not light
25:46
but it's not right
25:55
direction light the wave of
26:01
down system
26:24
doesn't want to have to
26:32
system
26:37
wave, microwave, infrared.
26:52
So if you go to my tit.com and you go to my um Tik Tok
27:16
[Music] system that's not deploying
27:22
This computer here is computer
27:33
system [Music]
27:46
computer doesn't understand instruction when the Wind plasma here doesn't disapp
27:57
plasmo plas. [Music]
28:02
system [Music]
28:13
like phasing need
28:20
[Music] to be enough to stabilize.
28:29
This is like
28:35
hide itself
28:52
to be angled and change the way You can get friends
29:01
about
29:08
This is a single single.
29:16
[Music]
29:24
Yes.
29:35
Okay.
29:51
And you get
29:57
uniforms. fields and clouds.
30:03
It's just [Music] energy
30:11
doesn't apply. Yeah. to become
30:19
a phone.
30:26
So guys, That's
30:34
expecting
30:42
this video. So my social media, my YouTube channel and
30:48
guys, [Music]
31:04
thank you. Share that
31:09
with us and we see you there. world.
31:17
Let's build Let's build Let's build a new Let's build a new
31:22
Let's build a new system. Let's build a new system for ourselves.
31:29
You know, you are actually about
31:36
Thank you. All right.
