Unknown Speaker  0:00  
Zero code, yep.

Unknown Speaker  0:02  
Geo code two, geo two, geo two. Okay,

Speaker 1  0:06  
it's not fine. Okay, so that's fine. So basically, I just can get from point A to point B. Point A to Point B, no, if no, box, you know. All basically, also invariant process, you know. So this way I go from here I go to the library. But you know, that's the large maximum places, the worst person trying to get to, like the place I'm trying to place I'm trying to get to, you know, no, that's like, the I'm really good today. I'm back small go to, I just get to that. I stay there, and then I can calculate back, you know, you know, for fucking a fucking six hours, and I come back to for the need, for the need. But if I want to sleep there, I sleep in library. That's work for my constitution. I'm watching you I can do that. I don't have to stop anything. So basically, the social one, so the wheel is like observing me. So basically, I don't say silicon, worst case, you know, worst case, you know, I can live with him, I can work, but I don't see, I don't hear, you know, because I can walk away, you know, through everything. But how do I get there? I get there? I can't get there. That's the computer. Do, you know, do for me, B, at B, A, B, this library, if I want to go to C, because I see which is like a gasses library one in Gaza, because quite far, you know, got a gasses library. Which library got, like a small one in basically, got a small one, you know, when you go to the library, and we got a small one there. But, you know, from the library tonight, you got a gasses library, the gas station library, and you got the library. I choose to do that too, because I want to go to library. You know, I didn't come into, you know, you know, that's a dual model. Oh, that's a dual exception model. The two ways to do something minimum for everything. Guys, that's a policy. Guys, you know, tonight closing my eyes because I know how to do that stress, but it should be less than 25 minutes, you know, no because, you know, don't tell me this couple of time. Tell me for five minutes. I should be there in 25 minutes. You know, just to walk me. I can walk there. Yes, I can walk there. But don't think for five minutes with that. You know, even you know, because your system is fragmented. Basically, the freedom system makes me a wonder. So I should be there in less than 10 minutes, maximum, depending on the weather, the time, things that we don't start with, opportunity to actually take an account, you know, the weather, things that make it easier for you to navigate. You know, seconds I cannot see. I can just walk there. Let me just walk down. Go walk there and come back to library.

Unknown Speaker  2:28  
I go there. Yes, I'm done. I go there, I come back. Done,

Speaker 1  2:32  
you know. But you know, it takes, why? Why it takes less time because I can see, I can see where I'm going, guys, no, so look at my app and say, Oh, well, that's fine. Let me go there. Now. No, no, no, no, let me go there. That's why the X, Y, Z continuous is working. Basically one more thing, yes, latitude, w2, latitude already. So this like a active system. Basically the filter system errors 92 the five. It fails its mode. Salesforce mode is like the filter system, like, you know, it's, it doesn't it helps us sparse attenuation engines, which I come to now, via the sparse matrix. Let me give example back, additional example here, example now, basically, what's my interpreter, or something sparse up. You know, when I open my top it up, you know, half the time, half the time login. So basically, auxiliary algorithms that are isomorphic. So this, like does be log n, log n bound. You know what happens? Basically notation in the protocol layer for the human being view the sensory interface should take anything a startup or anything more than a login, you know. You know, basically, if you guys include your only can make it. Encrypt your only chemical n but one can all log in. So basically all the order, basically, I can separate the present nodes because, you know, I can have, like, a observer problem and a consumer a problem there, but that's login separation. This model of log NIST, I can have like, um, two observer consumer interfaces, you know, like two to one mapping of the problem. You know, if I bind in here that observes the consumer, and just log in and do the consumer at n or not, and n linear time everything. Because, you know, there's been a time there that's a startup. And this has a startup that's fragmented, you know. So basically, let's have the kind of matrix that goes on this. Log n protocol for communication with me or interface me actually log in half the time because he we need it at end time. You know, because I'm an end human being. I lived in linear time naturally, because I just have to get, you know, if my boss said to me, come today, Nnamdi, let me do some work. Let's do some work. Let's work for the camera. I'll get in my own time. But my own time wouldn't be run, run, run, run, get there, work, work. You know, on time, because reading time is good enough to get me on time. Give them to me on time. So I'll do it to my own time. You know, when I start dope. Now get what's not a problem. So again, it's like half the time. If I get up now and get on both, be happy. Hey, when you come to work, give me my paycheck. You know, I'm gonna give my paycheck. You know, that's what I'm saying. My boss doesn't care about my my job. So basically, the observer consumers, you don't if you can observe and can you see myself, I can model myself. And then I the something has the K, basically, H, actually. So observes consumer model, i k, i k, k, myself. K means like, don't do for me, the buy my ticket observes. Consumer, that's two observer, consumer, resolution engine functions, the map has reduced homogeneous layers, making a total of 16 functions, because a time, if squared is 1616, functions can define. Can we fix using functions for k and i k resolution, because, you know, if k is a, if k is eight, so basically observer, basically to observe something and consume it. That's one pattern. And you know, then I have, like, a full time system. So if I do to consume that before, now, two, now, four consumer models for just the problem of logarithm X, and just define like four functions, or functions the map,

Unknown Speaker  6:08  
you know, framework@github.com

Speaker 1  6:12  
for benefits, function frameworks, that's busy, that'd be like a four problems. Now, these four problems have Islamic invariants, so after which ones that you know has to be stable. And I four functions, four times two, eight functions, eight functions for the protocol of log n, you know. So I have to find eight functions now. Now I have to define the field. Basically, I'm trying to give this information basically enough to have more functions to handle, like a fail safe category. So basically this how many, specifically they are. They are one, two. They are 3/5, categories, like a fail safe one, which is like a sparse model, actually model Hemi solution to a system that's the interface of one, filter two and three, basically the three feel safe. And the first 626, to 39 is a light shutdown, or life panic. You know, I panic. I quit and isolate. You know, you know, I isolate, and we for the human to recover. And then the,

Unknown Speaker  7:13  
God forbid, the one to 25

Speaker 1  7:15  
I start from scratch. You know, basically that happened between 30 to number 30 to 35 is like one phase of three, and start a component entirely, I start again. So that's what I mean. So basically, so now got what now guys? So basically, I've got the moment here, basically. So basically, I have a stopping that. So let's again, two pairs of consumer observer models, two times two is for, for, like a standard procedure of, you know, login protocol. So after send the login algorithms, four functions times two. Matrix, eight. Why eight? Because, you know, you got, like, the login problems that humans can base an IK principle. So go on to get K and IK now get it squared. H squared will be eight times two, which is like eight times oh, no, sorry, e times 2h, squared is not even true. Okay, so E times two is not E squared. So e squared is eight times two is four, 216, not 64 guys, I just heard that. So eight times two, eight times two, code, all the AIS and everyone I'm working with, e times two is 16, but 16 is not 64 it's not a square. So if I define two, defined 60 basically, if I do eight union eight, that means it is really eight times eight, or eight square or 64 so this is not writing all the functions. So at the maximum, using my functor framework@github.com forward slash off Oscar B for brava, I for Indigo and for November. S for Sarah, ob n x is forward slash functor s for function u, for umbrella n, for November, C, for city, C, for tour O, for onion, R, for router, dash for the dash. Frameworks, the word frameworks, the unit frameworks. You know, we have to have a minimum of 16 functions because, you know, that's why we have the 16 functions for coherence as a minimum viable product. So six to four functions, you know, functions that functions the map over here, basically, if I define this as a function, 6464 to the power of eight, basically. So this is 16 functions maximum to map across the system for the minimum viable product, Nnamdi and 64 functions total as a maximum for the minimum viable product. And the coherent key runs any implementation to map across functions. So basically, I should not have to keep this other start defining how this works. Basically, I'm aligning with the goal, the objective guys. Now if I say that the first one, this is default function MVP product, I can release this one today of geo code. This is parse, network locality, like you know, the locality of phenomenological observation of the web. I see the four squared I can do is four squared that this is the four times is the four and don't use it follow me correctly.

Unknown Speaker  10:20  
That's four. Functions. Oh, that's 404,096 functions.

Speaker 1  10:32  
You know, it's not confusing. So basically, you just get computers confused, you know, the real time. Basically, the AI should not hallucinate a function or even a structure. For example, you know, which I can model, you know. So I can define, after quit, after write 4086 functions, functions that map and solve the problem. If I do at the maximum locality, you know. And if I do the if I'm creating a mistake, obviously. MVP 116, to 2064, now, MVP, version one, version one, functions, functions. Now, attention to the data. Basically, you don't need any more input if it's not uniform. Basically the homogeneous one, basically the homogeneous one is like a so for 64 functions, I need 64 chemical inputs, 6064 because they're so morphic. You know, if they're uniform, isomorphic in uniform. And then that's like a same data input, the data specification, the schema, what I put into the current specification, you know, and then if I put the first version, this is just homogeneous, homogeneous function. That's homogeneous inputs. And same one, basically, if I'm creating MVP, now goes to same 16 functions, but that's uniform, especially uniform input, uniform things that are standardized by the interfaces, interfaces with, versus uniform information systems. These are really have the implementation uniform and, you know, no you from no information, no university can all agree. This is what we want to talk about. And they'll go 64 now. V1 basically my first version called with a runtime layer, and basically my phone. The problem just runs, basically the executed as compiled, but, you know, or whatever that's compiled, or the topic that's not running, if it's interpreted the model, basically an off program that customer interrupted, executed. Basically it can trace, basically the trace function. If I run the geo code in this touch mode, I can have the interpreted mode, which is just the app, and I can run so, so I'm going to find a function four to the power of eight, because, you know, there are eight functions. Oh, no, no, there's 60. This is the previous one. No, suppose the power of eight is not the minimum 1am. I thinking? So? Basically, if I do four to the power of times two, that will be

Unknown Speaker  13:00  
eight each at the end. Four times two is eight

Speaker 1  13:05  
functions, minimum, minimum. And then I did 64 Unix is a four times 64 which is 64 times four is what guys 64 times 64 and that's 496 functions, you know, but that's for the old one. Now, that's for my member by production, but, but, but other at MVP level, there's an overlap, basically. But at the version one level, I need to define 128 factors to ensure that I don't fragment the system and maintain my objective, which is log n, log n, log n bound. You know, functions that map across data layers. And if I basically my data, and that would be functions, basically in my digital real life. Now needs a functions, data and hundreds of eight times two, minimum inverse alone. What is it? A times two? Times two is what times two is what? Basically inspecting 256, data types to be present in my model, minimum, if I have the data of you only can prove otherwise. The data of inspecting

Unknown Speaker  14:18  
4000 4000 4096

Unknown Speaker  14:21  
1006 96 functors

Speaker 1  14:24  
input, and then that data is just for the MVP one for this past model, which can recover the after fact, if something breaks, you know, totally, you know, in the game. So this function data mapping is very important. This problem does it solves from, you know, seeking online with objective. You can solve problem based on getting guilty philosophy. But, you know, basically everything is a login because it's protocol bound. Basically, I want to open an app and the protocol I'm watching the system, you know. I don't want to ask, you know, but you know, isn't and, you know, N and above, I'm trying to, guys understand this linear time above you know, that's just too much. You know, you don't want me as to getting there in linear time, on time, just on time, you will actually get I don't be on time for everything in my life, on which time I know one time for everything my life. I know I don't be on time. Just be there when I need to be there.

Unknown Speaker  15:17  
Interest me. I don't go to this. So

Unknown Speaker  15:22  
that's go, here, stop now.

Unknown Speaker  15:31  
So, File, New, File, Export, export, audio,

Speaker 1  15:35  
let's call the geomorphology geospatch code or geospatch.

Unknown Speaker  15:39  
Cool. Runtime, runtime,

Unknown Speaker  15:44  
18, November, Oh, fine.

Unknown Speaker  15:52  
Let me export it again.

Unknown Speaker  15:55  
But this is like OG, oh,

Speaker 1  16:00  
other, oh, okay, basically, I've not done this. How much money have I got? Oh, for the woman. So basically the same thing for the country systems. Now the customer, basically the classify stuff without him to talk to talk to you. You know, you don't need any Ei, you just overhead, basically. So basically the XYZ, the plus x, minus x devices, basically the x, if I mean something here, could mean something other language, the words and words XYZ, coherence principles, basically, this is the worst case of everything anti is an anti analysis engine. So basically, you got the set nodes. So the set model basically add union and time. These are all coherent operators, usually using to do the same thing or in different fields or domains, the same thing. The price of this is just add the union system is just for set and the time is just for like, the same thing, a question. But, you know, they can be you basically the union, same one union is a unit. Is the same unit as a plus and a sign and multiply, depending on how you use it. But the unit is relative, you know, it's a modern system. So basically, sparse solution, the system must not hallucinations. Basically, it was not, you know, you know, it must not, you know, using AI to do it. You know, basically doing any AI to stop hallucination. You know, not overhead. You know, good companies can do everything today. So the thing is, the decision must be ignorant of intentional and, you know, potential and non potential incompetence, you know, so if I'm incompetent, you know, to walk, you know, potentially I'm competent if I don't want to walk, you know, work to work or incompetence. You know, even my traditional need to I don't really care. I don't really care. But it's not my job. It's something that stopped

Unknown Speaker  18:04  
me then she was at this point, hallucination.

Speaker 1  18:08  
Oh, no, this tiny one, that's the only one. No, no, let me start a new one. So basically, the system must remain again, XYZ, boundary, three minutes, for five minutes, for five minutes. Basically, that's saying basically XYZ cluster. Why? Basically, basically, my model of cane clustering, I may define K and cluster as this dimension reduction. So in dimension one, two and three, which are the key and biome clusters, you know, one, one is what formal. So basically, x can be formal and informal. Basically, the factual, basically, is good to move to the i axis, Y axis can say, I'm being factual. It's true, but my fact is not your fact. So you say, like, I don't know, phenomologically as a fact, but we do align. This is a fact. You're saying there's some kind of chemical relation of the effect that I know that you know, we're not telling me. So we just minus facts, and they got up down. They got minus plus minus on all sides, we don't align with that one, depending on our ratio of reference. Then you got up down, a plus minus x. So from fact, a factual to fiction, and then x, y is from formal, factual to formal section, because it's just y gates. And then you go to z1, with from so from formal to informal duality, phenomenological duality. You know, that's why we get confused in other visual communication, how you observe and preserve ourselves. And then we get a plus minus, and other one is like a Z, un factual. So we got the z1 how we get information like, you know, how we lend, how this new information become coherent to all of us, you know, in the group, two of us, you know, how we then agree on this protocol to solve this problem, resolve this issue. What is money? Basically, it's an anti Hertzian engine. So much I use a verb, noun concept or verbal direction. You know, the system is moving as low, relatively equal, absolutely. Relative is not absolute. You know, anything, even emotion, is relative. It's not absolute. And I was not relative, you know. So basically, there's some kind of characterization you can model for a system. But, you know, unless you can prove it's the same thing. Please. Anything I'm saying, Guys, I got how many moments ago? Like,

Unknown Speaker  20:28  
five moments so,

Unknown Speaker  20:31  
no, no. AIS red, black, elimination,

Unknown Speaker  20:35  
red to black. So the blackness of the BlackBerry is me.

Speaker 1  20:39  
I'm black runtime, basically the out front time just means, if the program is executable and linkable, I think time, it's interpreter. You know, because can execute Python code with a type compiler code, but you don't have to run the code. You can boost your Piper myself, this interpreted language is not compiled, and take this in engine. Basically the real world universe is nobody, coherent, no, AI, pollution, no, no. Invariance stuff, nothing. You need else. You know, if you don't need it, you don't need it. You know, even if you remove it, you remove it. You need to keep everything there. Just get the app in the fuel as the app Nnamdi in the clouds reform. You know, basically, obviously, it's acting something. Get it right. It doesn't need to do anything else, which to do anything else. Who's calling me five, no overhead, no AI, no citing. All policies are environments. So basically, I've introduced the no is legislation, the psychic things and the system coherence or model two more someone's calling me, okay, let me

Unknown Speaker  21:43  
just like, know, just my alarm. So

Speaker 1  21:48  
guys, 46 minutes, let me just stop this now, because you know, if I don't open this video now, my

Unknown Speaker  22:04  
Okay, so I just stopped

Unknown Speaker  22:06  
this Tiktok I cannot, obviously do all.
