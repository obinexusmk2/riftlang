Okay. Hello guys. Okay. Today's video I want to really talk about something really hard. It's something I call, you know, I'm trying to steal everyone's aura in the past. People actually can help us. You know, for me, I think it's just one initiative. I'm taking to for them because may not know the solution to a problem. You know, it's called PLP principle as a protocol. You know, guys, today's video is very important to me. You know, it means something uh to me as a child. Basically, someone called Mr. Sim

basically Mr. Sim was a teacher of French, you know, he was a good French teacher. I love that man, you know. You know, but no student, you know, it was a first year school. We need to talk to you about Mr. Mr. Mr. You know, you know, I had to had to really look at him like like him as he was. You know, you have to find out, you know, why it was that way. You know, it was strict in class. It was it wasn't like hard anything. It wasn't wasn't hurting anyone physically, but he knew how the system works. You know, he's telling us about our lives. He talk he's teaching he teach you, but you don't know he's teaching you. You know, you know this man understand what was the problem. Mr. Slim was a teacher was a teacher. Teacher I loved, you know, I loved him cuz he he was able to communicate effectively to me and not to others but in a more African way, you know, but it was it was modest. It wasn't like pushy. It was like you do it or not, you fail, you know. Okay. Mr. Lim was a a French teacher. I was 9 years old. No, I was 9 years. 9 years. I got to I was 11 years old. I got to French class. had a French but he didn't expect English you know in a French class speak French you know Mr. said you know not who got that but I understood that very well you know Mr. Selim understood that French was from French class only you know you know you're in French with him you French no one of English can ask in French if you want to hear English you don't say anything in English you know Mr. wasn't powerful. He couldn't make the law couldn't change anything in school. Yeah. He will show a puppet to them as well like me. I'm a to the to them like myself you know they don't know the poet school French but you know English but for me I am not the puppet no more I am I I am transcending the cycle of depression now may not be me to do it but I'm doing on his behalf you know he may go forget never see his video you know he may never find his video may never see what this what I'm doing for him you know here but Mr. Thank you very much you know you know I think about it I talk about it today is you know the 14th of November 25 Mr. Slim you know you are you are one of the best teachers there you know whether you know it or not you deserve you a gold medal you know two gold medals for that for that you know and why Mr. Slim you know I g in look your you know I'm going to do it for you and teachers like you you know you know you know so you know birectional in you know this is a great thing to understand you know Mr. Slim didn't know everything. He doesn't know everything. But he was able to communicate birectionally. That's two languages. You know, he can go to French class and mingle. You know, you can go to English class and mingle. You know, was able to navigate the system, you know, much better than me at the time. I can go French at the time, you know. But he's able to relay good communication very well guys able to even speak pigeon or like African like the broken English or the slang in UK and talk for you go through everywhere. You can't go to neighborhood. You can't go to the accepted guys. You know if you speak a street talk only can't go through the parliament do for processes do legal actions you know things are very formal you know you can't do it you know it's no way. So that's why birectional learning is very important. What does it mean to you? You know, you speak English, I speak French. You know, you can still communicate with one language. You know, English, you know, if you I speak French, you speak English. You want to speak French. This this really means a lot to me, guys. You know, I'm not doing it for the crowd. I'm doing it because it's mother's honest, you know. I want to think um think of me, you know, you know, actually making something better for everyone else, you know. I want to think of him me as he succeeded, you know. You may not know what this means to me, but you know if you only know one language, it doesn't mean anything to me. I mean policing
