Unknown Speaker  2:16  
I love my life. It's kind of funny. I'm

Speaker 2  2:20  
gonna harass all of you today. Oh, hello, Terry. Oh, you're working for a different team today. Terry, I'm surprised, Terry. CJ, is not with you. Yeah? CJ, it's like a collecting chips for them, because, you know, they give you chips. You stay with them, with the chips, okay? CJ, basically, I try to, you know, you don't actually talk to, you know that decency, respect, dignity. So basically. CJ, I put like Open Access reform. My basically change.org, such a full search. Obi nest, six underscore reform. If you click that rank, if you go to the URL, you get something called My hotel care sector reform. The first thing I've done is made a freedom inflation request to thorough Council. But you know, I want that done properly. So basically, I don't even want to deliver to my care home, because I don't trust these people. They're kind of funny. Basically, I want you basically, I'm gonna use the authority of Cambridge Council, because him counter has a verifier too. So basically, I call Cambridge Council. They can check it for me. It's there, you know, and go to council because already been nice, but you know, going to be all the way in Cambridge. Now, why Cambridge? Basically, they can basically, again, basically go to Cambridge court instead, because I said to them that cannot run for the court for the three or 3 million pounds lawsuit against them if they don't defend themselves, you won't lie to the judge or anything, you know, because, you know, I can't do it on money claim.org because it's too much money, because of my piece of history of abuse and all of that, so that money can control for code undisputed if they wanted legal team or not even the stupid or lower Boomi, or the people that give me the wrong emails because not give me half. So she's fine her daughter, or it's not even her Oh, or they can go to Kim's quote to dispute it, but, you know, it's fine if I don't get that money to Russia by human rights because, you know, I have done everything according to human rights law. That's actually two or three, because basically they give me something, which means, like, I am not homeless. I have a house, but I had a basically, the next day I appealed it because I got today, and I demanded something called damages. So basically, the that's the damages. Basically, I was in institution under care nine years old. I didn't sign myself up for this kind of service, so I came to social care nine years old, but I didn't set up for this animal. Put my pension. I want to concentrate. I don't, I don't want to be there because, you know, I know my rights to it. So because, you know, it's kind of Nigeria, so basically, gonna stand human rights law business. It's one, one up. It's money. But, you know, people don't know the human rights. That's why these people are getting away with it. You know, because anything they in the right by emails. They are public authority, so they're private or protected by governments. They're just not like a CIA. They just open to the public. You know, they know, say to me, to the public, I'm sort of a human being. I can fight from human. I didn't know I can fight everyone. So basically, it's a shock, dumb diet. I know how to do this, but, you know, I'm full of surprises. I'll say. So basically, give me the first email for that. So my social workout, Mr. Mr. Femi for me, but Whoa, for me. Doesn't know I'm part of men, sir, who should you present out into the society? You know, I came in, I got intervention when I was 11 years old. I did something called a bent test, and I got, I got 98% of intelligence. Basically, I go to two percentile group, and that's basically a 14. I went to Oxford University. I did apply my artist and creative writing, you know, basically message reviews give my data too, because they have a data recovery service. And now for my detail from Mensa, and Mensa refused my data. Say, don't exist. You're on the record. But even check anything No, because you have the service ready, you should be working, you know, you know. So it's not no excuse for this. You get it. So I'm gonna see Master two, but integrator Cambridge for my PhD. But I have to deal with these people yet. So basically, um, basically the proof message here, basically, I didn't social care, basically human rights. So you're gonna start his own money. Let me explain to you. CJ, so basically, CJ, what someone says you have your own right. It doesn't mean shit. You know, it doesn't mean shit. Bear with me, for example, because, you know, I can say you have human rights because you have them. You have something. You own something, but you don't know what you own. You get I'm saying, CJ, you know, they don't really understand why it's valuable. You get it. You get it. So basically, that's, indeed, how many people who they don't put the human rights, they take the red pill, human rights, and say, Okay, you need house. Go buy house. I know my rights to house. Any I need free, independent housing. You know, if I don't know my rights to housing, then I'll, I'll be stuck in social care forever, etc. You know, that's saying so and they and, you know, they want you to take the red blue pill. Somebody take the red pill. They go to go comply, to go silent. They go to completing your pain and suffering of no housing. I said, not with me with an email. So basically that's section 184, 13. Basically, I was in my situation when I was 15 years old, but the care ends 25 years old. So basically I need to get a house now or never leave. You know, that's the law. You know, that's low, you know, staying care home. You know, which I wish. I wish my goal was housing anyway. So anybody that tell me to stay in camp, she put that money in my bank account, and I still buy a house. Um, but you know, that's I'm saying. I did a problem. But don't worry about them. Came your mindset stuff, you know? Because, you know, I keep moving places. It's a really annoying me, you know, I keep I go here. They say, you know, I go here. They say, No, look, can they better do their job, do their job for once in their life. Not you. CJ, you know, you just collecting chips. You don't know what's going on there with these people and when they write emails. CJ, CJ, look, if it wasn't, it wasn't. CJ, okay, basically, so. CJ, you know, Nigeria everything, it's just what it is. Same thing happened. Most is happening here. They think they can get a here. They didn't even get away with this, with me, but not with me, not with me. CJ, not with me. You can, you know, they can see what they want. But you know, basically, right now, the thing about this, you know, if I commit a crime while doing this, you know, and it goes against me anyway, she performed, you know, then I become a criminal, and the law can do something about it, but, you know, I'm I'm busy, I'm rebelling, but I'm not rebelling with a weapon or something like that. I'm not armed, I'm not honorable, you know, I'm just like, you know, in the room that's dirty, that's thinking, and you know, I'm just calling them, insulting them, you know. But you know, you know, that's like a standard procedure, you know, I said to them, you know, put the million pounds in my bank account, you know, you know, you know, I showed them my picture, my wallet is empty. You know, that kind of stuff is insulting. And, you know, the United Nations gonna do something about it eventually. But they're very slow. Basically, he knows they're very slow, because these people can get away with any things right by, you know, you know, what is King it's very slow. You know, it's like, you know, it's like, you observing something, they can't change it because, you know, you can't change how fast or change how far some type of email anyway. So basically, I come for day today for the division white paper, you know, because they have to abide by that. Because, you know, I lost a personas. I can't do myself no more. You know, that money, 10,000 pounds, I say, for two years, school to Cambridge University. But you by law, by law, I don't the law. CJ, you know? CJ, I don't need the loan by law. You have to be financially stable to get some money account, and you have to have what stability in the community. You know, that's a few things you need. I lost it. There's a powerfulness and you know, that's where I can't even go financially. You know, I couldn't buy a house. But you know, you know, that's every family, basically, that's saying to you. But you know, the housing are free for new divergence people. People are autistic, you know. But, you know, I can't go. I missed this year, so I have to go next year by 10th of November to by 10th November to first October after be there before the deadline closed for my PhD. But you know, they don't seem there was in the time in that office. You know, I don't basically, the basically, although we should do me fight immediately, and Femi should just be fired. You know, Femi should just be people that fight. You mean, they don't have diploma. You know, I've got recording here for me saying he don't have a diploma. I send that to, I send out to Cambridge court, and that's money in my bank account. Because, you know, Femi said I don't have a I don't. A bachelor degree, have a diploma, you know, you know you didn't have a diploma. You know, he says you don't have a bachelor or diploma. So basically, that's evidence against him, but it's not gonna come from him his accounts, because he's a, you know, he's a human being, too. But this is not actually defending it, you know, if he tries to defend it, it comes out his account. But you know, rather, I'd rather just get the money from the however, the pain were paying taxes, you know, because that's more easy to do. For example, if I, you know, can tell you everything about myself, but you know, I'm just like having lonely because, you know, I have no friends, but they could just give my 10,000 pounds back, you know, and solve this problem. But it tends to fight me with an email, which you never know they're doing, but I don't really care no more. So basically, that's what's happening today. So me, I really got food, everything. Only call them for the original white paper and tell them that some that, you know, I'm still alive and well, you know, whether they care not, it's not my problem, because I never do care. But, you know, I'm building my own go as a framework. So basically, I'm building everything I couldn't build, you know, because, you know, they basically, I'm trying to enforce something called, like, you know, some kind of legal framework around the kind of monopoly and harassment that happens in that thing and get away with it, you know. You know, you know, you put that money my bank account, not their bank account. You know, several million pounds. 3 million pounds is how it works. You know, basically, if I didn't claim that 30 million pounds, you know, just don't get worse for people like me, autistic people, you know, just generally, because, you know, I didn't build on myself, you know, the person, basically, last year we lost, we lost. I say we, I say we, me and you. But you know, not we, we would, I care. You know, we lost some of the million pounds of our taxpayer money, and then we got, what did the evolution? Now the evolution automatically has me power, if you know, you don't know. So basically, now you evolve. And so let me explain to you, basically when something devolves against everyone gives everyone gets more power. The people that know what they're doing gets more power. The kind of, if I get batteries within social care now I can get more power to act on the government authority level, you know. But you know, that's how it works. You know about the governance people? You know, people like, Lord be me and a stupid daughter, because they don't know what they're doing in that in that room, you know, just there for the money collecting chips, I call it.

Speaker 2  12:04  
So basically, Newham Council, the one I was with when I was nine years old, evolved. You guys devolved at the same time. Funny enough. But Newham Council evolved. Basically they are decentralized. Now. There's no main office for the council. You don't even walk. So basically that building you're sitting in, doesn't exist in the new home borough, you know, Newham at all. There's no building go to, you know, you just make a phone call. You get a house. You just make a phone call, you get a you know, for me, it doesn't really mean anything, you know. But you know, basically, because if you go to government, you have to know how the internet works, you know, I have to use the phone everything to get to the service, you know, you know. So new income works like that. But these people are harassing me. Me, personally, I don't do anything to them. They're harassing me. So basically, Cambridge Council, King Council, long time ago, King council have like something called so big. King Council is 24 hours. So if you go to the council, they evolved a long time ago before go to the council building, it's 24 hours. Everyone is sitting there, not you, not you, but you know, there's a time that someone has a shift. Everyone's not like that. You know, they haven't evolved. People going backwards. You know, I even want them to devote further so I can come up, go, come on, remove that council building. You know, basically how they basically, you see, it's like a rule back. So basically, it's robot to stability. So basically, the drug division, why people? It's like, you know, for third only, but it's one for, like, a UK, because UK do often, because people not building houses or getting houses, you know, that's why those people are leaving. That's why, that's why people are leaving UK, you know, I you know, there's no way, nothing to do because, you know, even the billionaires that want to invest in things don't have anything they want to do there. So they leave because, you know, there's no stability, you get it. So that's what's really happening. But, but they don't stand you know what this actually means for them? You know. So for me, you know, for me, if they think they can, they can harass me with a weapon or gun, or can cause someone against me. They saw that legally. They can try and do that, but it doesn't. They can never get to do with me personally, because, you know, I haven't harassed anyone. You know, no show this crime that's happening. You know, the councils have can, you know, Council can literally just stop someone getting crossing, the crossing the trains. You know, you know, trains try this. They can stop with that nonsense, but they don't need a job. Or do you care? You know, basically I go say she wanted your phone. Means I'm not homeless. Now I cannot go to Cambridge with my human rights. You know, that's basically that just strips out. They can do all of that for criminal you know people that living in that borough. You know people that does just keep killing people, harassing people, don't care. You know, you know, I see people homeless on the street in those as the, you know, like in the sagebrush opposite the council when you cross the train tracks. You know, people on the street sitting there, and counselors are in office. I'm saying now, do you see what happening? That same thing happened in Nigeria. Same thing. It's getting worse. CJ, CJ, CJ, CJ, look, look, I'm not here to dispute anything. But you know, they know they know what he did, so I'm speaking to them now, not me. Basically, I just need my thing. I'm just telling what I'm needing. I'm not making any demands today. I'm just, really just sorting out the money issue with my bankruptcy. Because, you know, today I've got to, obviously, I filed for bankruptcy because I lost 10,000 pounds. I had to do it all. The online system. So I don't know online, the government solves the act of 1998 issued to me. So basically, I don't get any money because, you know, I can file for bankruptcy, but then, so easy act, because I didn't when I was bankrupt, they said to me, why are you bankrupt, Nnamdi? You know, Nnamdi basically said, I love 10,000 pounds homeless, because evicted me. But, you know, they don't stand what that means. So basically I'm not allowed any money, and basically my money will go blocked. You know, I didn't call in the government, government officers like, you know, just throw that insomnia team for the food to unlock my cart so can buy food. You're someone saying, you know, that's what it means. You know that didn't, don't know why go bankrupt. You know where the money came from, what I was human rights or something like, human rights or something like, you know, because, you know, that's what it means. You know, something is going wrong with our system, and now it's like a problem, you know, I didn't stand that, you know, I just thought, I'll get 60,000 out. But that's what that means. That's, I'm saying that's in Soviet act 1988 so I'm basically, basically, my issue of bankruptcy cannot be solved. I can get withdrawal 60,000 but what I can do, what I can do is they give me something called a BK at my reference number. What I can do is use that 60,000 to solve my issue of money. So basically, I don't get the money directly, but I can call my people that owe him money to, you know, personally, and say, okay, hey, three network, I owe you ABC. So basically, that's 1000 is to pay for my debt. You know, only my debt. So basically, basically 60,000 the money. Basically, I use that money to call the people a budget. Give them the number, give them the number, my reference number, and that Reference Number goes to the industries like three, network talk, talk people. I owe money to my, you know, his domain, you know, okay, look, look, look, see, do see it. CJ. CJ, no, CJ. CJ, please, please. I'm gonna, I'm gonna put someone else. I don't know what to go about this, but you know, someone say now, so basically, I'm gonna go really eating everything but, CJ, basically, that money, that money, I do 60,000 so I own I owe it because, you know, owe to the people. So I literally just call them and declare bankruptcy to them, you know. And includes, basically, they close the service to me because, you know, I'm affordable. I get money. Basically that 3000 is minus anything I pay. Like, if I order three pounds to a service, I pay 50 pounds, you know, it's 60,000 to one service, you know. Or so, you know. But you know, that's the Soviet act 1998 that's this is government to my money right now. But you know that's angry because, you know, I just try to get money out. And you know, they keep on harassing people, these people. Oh, yeah, CJ. CJ, go. Goodbye. Take care. Have a lovely day. I Love You do look, look, CJ, CJ, if anybody saving to you, just say to them, I mean, I'm with Nnamdi. Michael Obama, let's see what they say. You know, you know. And then see, oh, so you know Nnamdi, so like, you know, like your friend to me, not like you normally, like personally will have money, because let's see how scared they are.
