Unknown Speaker  0:04  
A open sense

Unknown Speaker  0:11  
recording, no, it's not good in here. This is good in here. So this recording force, sorry, guys, let me show this video now.

Unknown Speaker  0:23  
So this is like my lecture. This is very important since done, because usually called Open sense

Unknown Speaker  0:29  
matrix, open low for Oscar, P for Papa, E for Echo N for November, S for sensory E for Echo N for November, E for Echo,

Unknown Speaker  0:44  
Sarah E for

Unknown Speaker  0:48  
Echo. Open sense, dash framework, because that's open source, new definition. So Muco systems, Muco M for mother and

Unknown Speaker  1:00  
for Mike. So that idea, so this open sense is like the hardware position.

Unknown Speaker  1:07  
So I think you may be not understanding me, but you know if you understand anything, because human rights seven times seven, so my sight, my taste, my touch, my teeth, my smell, my ears and my skin on my turn, 1234566,

Unknown Speaker  1:27  
senses, eyes, taste, nose, touch,

Unknown Speaker  1:33  
five and then fasten, is there and my intake, my intuition of my intake and My relay, my output, how I respond to him, my information, person, via the temporal lobe. My dad, I don't know It's a woman. What is it? My testimony, my test version, but you know, it's with a flashbang. So, like, you know, I don't want to give you the jargon, yeah, but you know, when is a fight, there's a fight. Where's the fight? There's a fight. So basically, in defense of empirical system there, but it's bound to that it's kind of some central position from a bit of fight or flight response, you know, in real time. So obviously music that adapts to your space. For housing, it's very important you understand it's just not for housing, it's for your mood, you know, having headphones using blue Share. So basically, blue Share allows you to polyglot and interact some streams you can interface, can be token on a blue Share network booted that can share over for people in a choir room, and you can hear to them. But you know it's open sense boundary, because you know these are things that you have to, usually clean up a room your house, you put in your assets, and you do your job. But you know that has the key situation, that person you know, CCNA,

Unknown Speaker  2:56  
assessing your mood, coming your mood. That's what the open sense dash matrix open sensor policy is for so she got my Alexa here. I lost Alexa. But, you know, I want to show you what it means. So basically, you know, I don't want to give you guys the bigger to do it perfectly first time. So we do it without going into the words. We can talk about it. Alexa resume, you

Unknown Speaker  3:40  
I

Unknown Speaker  3:53  
have a first one, Alexa, next I

Unknown Speaker  4:09  
Alexa, next.

Unknown Speaker  4:15  
I love this one. This is more of my job.

Unknown Speaker  4:34  
Alexa, pause, so basically, I'm not doing it. Basically, I love that last one. There's third one. I love that the best one. Second was okay, but I wasn't really understanding and the first one understood it, but couldn't make fruits. That's a third one. So I love the third one because, you know, I understand the song, you know.

Unknown Speaker  4:59  
So the third song was like,

Unknown Speaker  5:02  
so there's some kind of music theory, sensory I like, essentially, like, I'm just a skill. I'm still on special. But some EDG aspect is bipolar, if you really hear my bipolar, but the bipolar was some active civility. I felt like, I want to get up on work, this kind of gym, this music for study, for what? But it's in your environment. It's like, you know, it's, you know, obviously, if you have the Alex, you can pull up some time up or some blue noise. But that's not perfect, so you have to adapt to actively do do that when you want to turn off, you see it turn off, you know, no matter how tired you are. So you can actually do your work perfectly. So that last song was really good to know, copyright sounds, I'm not breaking that policies anything, because no focus. No, there's no it's just, you know, for everyone. So there's no copyright songs, NCS on media, social media. So last one was really done to get up to work and do

Unknown Speaker  5:55  
what he made me do it. But you know, how do you make it to understand the meaning? So it's kind of a meaning to it, and that means the most freedom I saw. Heat of my soul's my heart, my body, my mind. And also, let me do a series, like a breath on puts you basically, for some people who want to actually design, basically the

Unknown Speaker  6:12  
music shifter, fighting, fighting, and Taylor is to calm down. But, you know, there's no medication involved in this kind of so obviously preserving the environment that sustains them. That's why open sense is important.

Unknown Speaker  6:29  
Open sensory patients oversens matrix. So you get 63 residents. Now you get seven dimensions, maximum for one person, we get a shared dimension of certain seven is 49 for 16 plus 53

Unknown Speaker  6:42  
shared spaces of dimension, or accesses the dimension operation. So you get seven dimension as maximum. Get the union dimension

Unknown Speaker  6:49  
intersect in the basis of how dynamic activity. So the open sense matrix is some bipolar two. So you could get the bipolar measures you got each unit, because you get, if you get 14 to 14, eight to 16. Basically seven is 14, so it gives you eight to 14. But that's okay enough to get easy because, you know, we double it instead to get the open sensor zone for due opportunity, angry and sad or some kind of complex emotion

Unknown Speaker  7:21  
the company pinpoint, or to find a signal in that motion so can put meaning to it. So I can under speed illustrator See that's what I'm saying. So this open system is used to have sign or can also don't be like a boring room come in. So this was open sensory.

Unknown Speaker  7:36  
Open sense on github.com, for such open access. Open sense framework to for new divergent of my whole 10 system, how this things you like, we like, we don't like good beat and a bad beat. Some symphonies can model with the school students, but it doesn't really resonate. It's not really active. It doesn't really know you, doesn't really understand your way of feeling. And that's basically, it doesn't matter where you are, you know. It's gonna catch you up to you, you know. So you can tailor it to what you need, some precise samples, you know. But it's like a generative music,

Unknown Speaker  8:16  
Gaming Music. I call it generative music because it allows you to, it's like, um, it's like the watch with noise, the wave noise format for the movie does visual with some user

Unknown Speaker  8:31  
letter, but really adapts ways and it sounds on your family doesn't really program it Just, just program seed that keeps, like, two Cs or two forces in the background. It's a background music for life, I call it. So that's okay, no matter what the game is that we play the video game and you're shooting someone on quality, the music for the background keeps you focused in the game, because that background music is your reality, you know, and that reality, if you stop that, if you press that stop button, you lose the version in the game too. So basically, it's meant to keep you focused, weak and active. For me, personally, it means a lot, no matter the presence. But why does it really matter?

Unknown Speaker  9:16  
Alexa regime,

Unknown Speaker  9:20  
so for me, it matters because you can hear it now, see it's because, you know, if I close my eyes, I hear the music as much as a smell. So I'm just actually my sense.

Unknown Speaker  9:32  
I'm really Yes.

Unknown Speaker  9:37  
So here I'm breathing. I understand the music. Basically, I want to try to

Unknown Speaker  9:42  
notice people for people. So this music is giving me meaning. There's meaning to it, the meaning of notice what I like that's wise manner.

Unknown Speaker  9:50  
So there's a meaning to the way for the music, sample, the hit,

Unknown Speaker  9:58  
basically the trouble, the high boots. To note the spacing the white boots. It just has to be voices. Can be like the Mozart, kind of singing,

Unknown Speaker  10:07  
Felix, some kind of opera singing, which is the best one, some kind of

Unknown Speaker  10:14  
system that preserves you while you do it. But it's really a background noise. You get the background here. You get the mid ground reader. You get the foreground. So this is the foreground so this is the foreground. Here. I'm trying to protect myself to the foreground. It's a

Unknown Speaker  10:25  
messy room, but the foreground is not clear enough, so I can't really do my next thing because the music has to get steep. Friend, I'm getting a headache, so I'm closing my eyes. Your head goes the music mechanical. Alexa, pause. So pause.

Unknown Speaker  10:41  
So as you can see, the risk is going now. I can see myself focusing now, obviously, that with them, if I go in the real world, it just plugs in my head and it keeps me sleep, but I don't have to get headache. I don't hear any other things here. I think because it's no it's really the goal. Obviously, the goal of the system is ensure the flexibility for neurod beginner, relay. This is in the head all the time. But that thing must not distribute the flow. It'll be their background when did not have it, um, because it is like um, an aorm. So let's have an airm that just come it doesn't we really think about and start to play the the winner, state of concentration, focused and hyperfinex, and they already themselves. They're being authentic. There's no it doesn't really affect their state of mind anymore, because that state of mind has been because they work and they live and they breathe and they just does not deal with them. That's routine they already know, so they don't go back to some kind of deviation from it. So if they can sleep with them, it's the best. Obviously, you can blast these people. They work with them. Live with them forever. But you know, it's very their natural

Unknown Speaker  11:51  
chicken cycle. So basically, no matter what they're doing, they have this kind of music. That's it could be like a ring sound Alexa play, ring sounds.

Unknown Speaker  12:08  
Alexa play, blue noise

Unknown Speaker  12:16  
is beautiful, but I can hear it. It just kills all my wisdom, or my problem issues, like something in the mood that I can resume, but allow me to focus. This is no other measure here, something there that's popping my

Unknown Speaker  12:37  
consultation.

Unknown Speaker  12:40  
Focus on things. Clearly over my ears and my mind. Some kind of

Unknown Speaker  12:52  
play. Will Alexa play whale noise?

Unknown Speaker  12:57  
Alexa, please. Alexa, pause, so that's like a white noise one. It does the same thing. It's just more focus on basically, what's the noise? Basically, noise for generative lattices, like a generously and gently come randomness, micro corresponding before waveforms.

Unknown Speaker  13:21  
Got that one, then you got that one, like

Unknown Speaker  13:26  
you collect the modulator, the noise, the PNG noise one, and you got the piecewise noise you got, like the noise you got other type of noise can use to generate entropy in a system. But, you know, the goods have it origin itself and evolve as you do this without individual that watching their daily activities, how they touch stuff, what they do they need for medication, initial form. But you know, as a policy, enforcement, like some kind of useful at least, have a place you listen to it, definitely in your house, so you have, like, a record a store

Unknown Speaker  13:57  
room is like, this is a room that you have, but there's a your business, your room. It's like your

Unknown Speaker  14:02  
room, but it's still so you can work there if you want, but it's something useful, once again, extra room you have, because still, still conservatory. So basically you have two coverages. Everyone has to cover through. But, you know, you have a storeroom. Entering a store covers. You get a lot of spaces to breathe, you know, because if there's information, go mad. So we're the one that. So you get one store, one building, one one consortium, you see the garden,

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
and one garden leads the garden, the one in the coverage to have the food. So you can have one food whatsoever. You can easily wash your room. Still rooms are the still commercial rate is for Smoking Cigar. You can use them anyhow you want. But you got to discover for the food, for plantation, anything you want to do, whether that corn, cornhopes or weeds, or grain or rice, yam, pepper soup. Go

Unknown Speaker  15:01  
see things that you love. You don't. You prepare us. You don't. You don't have to go to the shop because they grow on the ground naturally. Or the young Food Festival, it goes inside the ground. That's kind of let's go.

Unknown Speaker  15:14  
So basically, the goal of this is to ensure that there's no fragmentation in the foundation. Need the field was shorter. Alexa, the way of sounds.

Unknown Speaker  15:30  
Alexa, never mind.

Unknown Speaker  15:35  
Alexa. Resume,

Unknown Speaker  15:42  
so it's my favorite one. Guys, that's my favorite one. There's like a wheel singer, we have got to do that. Your shrimp. That's what it sounds like. You know, this is so beautiful. Guys especially, will a journey to me.

Unknown Speaker  16:00  
It's well, that, you know, we can't see they see them, but it's so big. So now this world is going up and down. Basically it's voice acting for

Unknown Speaker  16:11  
sound. So basically, I'm trying to go to the speech my friend, Oh, hello. How are you? He said, he's fine. Basically, I need a story up in my head. He says, Oh, you come to me. Someone will come with you. I want to come with you

Unknown Speaker  16:26  
15 meters. I can't go over 10,000 meters.

Unknown Speaker  16:31  
Basically, yes, I love you. I love you.

Unknown Speaker  16:36  
So

Unknown Speaker  16:41  
well I'll marry you. Marry me as well. It just makes sense to me. There's no need to think about it, because I know it will sound but I'm getting more meaning from this world without being well,

Unknown Speaker  16:59  
I'm being myself in the way which perfect, because, you know, the store rooms allow me to want to fragment the system, get extra rooms. There's no fragmentation and the stones and the stock conversion. There's something there for me to go to if I want extra space. Every space is there room and still cover? Sure. Thank you guys, I got a family still room. Okay? Thank you guys. You.
