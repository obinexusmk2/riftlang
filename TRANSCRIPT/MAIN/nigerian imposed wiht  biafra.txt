need a convolution program. Uh, I need that uh as soon as possible. 
I'm an Tor over 10 years I want to build independent social housing 
for neurody divergent individuals. So we are a contractor so we're not company. 
I need to contact contractor. Yes. I I don't know how to do that but I've got the construction 
number from the council. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I know that. So you don't know the contractor's 
number then. So I'm not too sure what contract you're trying to No, no, no, no, no. But you 
know then what's your role at the council? Cuz you know the council said you may be able to 
assess. That's why I'm a bit confused. So we're not we're not a council. We're a voluntary 
organization that contractors can sign up to because we champion higher standards 
in the construction industry. But we're not a contractor and we don't do any building 
higher standards. So does that mean you're not just regulators? So we're not a regulatory 
body. We do not have enforcement powers, but we have a checklist that our monitors use 
when they visit. Look, look, madam. All I need is clarity. I'll call you back. Okay. So we 
Yes. Yes. Yes. Madam Madam, madam. Madam, madam. You stated that so many times. I need 
clarity. Like I stated, I'll call back. inquiry. That's what you're saying. What priority do 
you need, sir? Look, madam, this is a this is housing construction. The thorough council gave me 
this number. Yeah. So, you wanting you're wanting to build houses? Yes. Yeah. So, we're not a 
contract. Yes. I know you're not a contractor. So, there's been some kind of misunderstanding. 
I'll call back. Thank you, madam. Okay. Bye. Hello. Hello. This is the civil council. Yes. 
Oh. Oh. Hello. Hello. There. Speaking. Is this the is this the reception? No. This is this is 
the leader's office. My name is Tracy. You've spoken before. Oh. Oh. Hello Tracy. Oh. Oh. 
Sorry. uh leaders office. I I should change his number. Are you just civil counsel? I got 
it wrong. Okay. Tracy, um you see you're in the script. You say you'll be back in two weeks 
time. I really don't think so. But you know um you know people are the bureaucrats are just 
talking writing emails and uh like always um but you know they keep harassing people. So basically 
this morning I called um I called regarding my other um my my second application uh asked for 
a freedom of pass and the careless oyster and they're wasting time. I was trying to um um uh 
uh make a joke on their expense. I said um sorry. No, no, no, sir. Madam, madam, madam, madam, 
please understand the situation. These people are abusing me. They're abusing me. I stated under 
the health care act 2014. They put me in offer. Yes. Cuz they spending their services. I said 
I want a house and I'm still in social care. I know no one cares, but it's my problem. No one 
should care for my problems. I don't want them to care for my problems. I'm an independent man. 
I'm going to say as if I'm an independent man. I'm going to Cambridge really like a lot and I've 
lost £10,000 homeless. My lawsuit is £300 million solely because I've been for a year when I saw UFO 
and lied because I saw I saw nothing. So obsessed UFO but UFO can mean can mean anything just 
means anything on the unidentified flying object for being harassment abuse. No one council 
did nothing to get me out or use my whereabout because they just sign into any institution. 
Secondly I was my social care because I'm so poor I can't get myself out of social care myself. 
I I saved to my business for university and and it was lost cuz I was homeless under council. Now 
I'm back into tradition, you know. You know, I'm just making sure that they keep track of 
what's going on cuz I'm not the one at fault. It's them that is causing the problem obviously. Unless 
it's just a business. Who is them? Who is them, sir? Who is them? Madam Madam, do you have Do 
you have to explain the history of Nigeria to you? Do you have to explain what a Nigerian is? 
You know, look, madam, let me just put it. Madam, madam, let me just give let me just give you the 
breakdown. Let me just give you the breakdown cuz I'm speaking. Damn, damn. Damn. The word 
damn. So, who is it? I can speak to. Madam, madam, madam. Madam, madam. Speaking to 
these people does nothing to do nothing. What would you like me to? How would you like me 
to proceed because a couple of times now? Well, madam, madam, we have to kick them out. Madam, 
I said to them under the program, I'm going to come there and change how they work. They bar me 
from the council because they want to say they keep their narrative. Keep their narrative. Why? 
because their narrative is more important than whatever my home situation is, my house situation 
is to them because that you giving them you pay them too much. Madam, madam, I swear to God, if 
you pay them 10%, let's say, let's say, let's be honest, 10% less, you know, say give 100, they'll 
learn just slightly but not too much. it comes to their actions because they can do anything 
anything there you know whether it's write emails to put someone in whether it's someone for 
harassion and they deny someone housing you know you know cuz it's good to many other people you 
know you know you know I'm not I'm not going to blame maybe just them but you know but you know 
there's two sides to this story like I'll tell everyone there who's listening but not acting 
doing anything there who's hitting the seats Okay. So, madam, madam, madam, madam. So, what 
madam? Power like them. Why don't you take the initiative like and write an email for them 
to do their job if you don't want them to? If you want them to resolve it, you know, you 
know, you can't tell them. Madam, madam, you can't tell them. Firstly, sir, firstly, sir, 
I am just the assistant to the leader. I have no authority. What? I didn't know. What? I didn't 
know my madam. I didn't know. I I didn't explain I didn't explain that yesterday. Well, you didn't 
tell me she was she was then Did you Why did you say you wouldn't believe that? Why did you say you 
confused me anyway? Well, I just interpreted where interpreted interpreted also. Sir, I have also 
passed your details on to and I'll speak to the leader. I also passed your details on sir. Not 
When you say them who you are refer to clarify them then okay should clarify them to you for 
medical school. It would be nice. Yeah. Okay. Like um like I was saying so basically in Nigeria you 
don't know Nigeria. Niger is not a country. I'll tell everyone that pro 10,000 times over it is 
not a country. Let's go to the history of Nigeria. Nigeria. So we had the something called BRA. I'm a 
BF by the way. Beer means come and FRA means take BRA means come take her you know and that was the 
land that was there that was the that was where I'm from. There was no Nigerian you know you know
