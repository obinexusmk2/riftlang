Unknown Speaker  0:04  
You start

Unknown Speaker  0:06  
recording here too. I

Unknown Speaker  0:08  
hope it does properly.

Unknown Speaker  0:11  
Now, okay, I can store recording this. Okay, let me use otter. Ai, let me just use the Okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:19  
Otter is recording this. So this is a backup, okay, video, start now,

Unknown Speaker  0:26  
three, two, okay. So, guys, today's video

Unknown Speaker  0:31  
is on personal development. Guys, you know this is gonna be a long, detailed video.

Unknown Speaker  0:42  
Hopefully. You can get it, because, you know, I've been trying to make you for a long time, um, basically, my life work. I'll leave myself out, who's Nnamdi? Basically, am I? Basically, I'm conscious. I don't have body everything. But I don't feel like this is me, per se, because I'm so much more It feels different to my community. I don't feel like I don't feel like it's me. Let me give example. This is me. I want wings to fly first of all, but I don't have wings. It's kind of funny, because I want wings, but I went to have to grow wind because also like, enough me, also like, fly, like, you know, little wings, like backwards, or you can fly to school, fly, just fly my hands and just fly, or flat my hands. You'll be fine. I'll be blinded to school or like, like the flying without any obstruction because I was going to school, which is like Gayle Academy lake. So this is important for me to say. It's about personal development. It's like, Mike, you call me Mr. Obi. OBI, Miss hot OBI, heart of soul, but that's my persona right now, which is nutshell me. For me, I want to like diamond teeth, you know, I want like a tattoo, you know, diamond, but it's not really a diamond. Like a braces, but they, but these kind of things are like diamonds for the teeth, but they do some flat sound. It's like, but it's like diamonds, like, actually, I should for Sapphire. The Sapphire is more expensive because, but the thing about that is, like Sapphire is like a rock mineral. So the mineral my teeth, you know, but my persona, want to use my sauce because, you know, it's more sustainable. Basically call me Nnamdi, Obi Nexus, Nnamdi. My name is Nnamdi. Michael Okpala. They can call me and Mr. Obi, which means heart, or solely liberal, but don't mean I have a heart. I mean, can say Mr. Evil heart. I don't care. I don't have the word heart in it, because the good is technical, because basically about my struggles. That's my avatar. One of my friends can call him G, but, you know, my friend call him G, but what does G mean? What does G mean? What does King one doesn't mean it's just a persona. Basically, a six, nine is a good example.

Unknown Speaker  2:48  
What's a good Eminem?

Unknown Speaker  2:50  
Because he liked his choice. Was he, I think he was his sweet tube. That's why he had that. Because that is roughening persona. A lot of Persona have deep personas rooted in their DNA and everything their body. People that have personas development

Unknown Speaker  3:06  
are happy, more happier than people that don't. It's not they, they're not more fulfilled, more sustainable. It's never really about,

Unknown Speaker  3:14  
really about

Unknown Speaker  3:16  
really it's not really about a copying or fitting in. It's about your identity, your anchor,

Unknown Speaker  3:23  
who you see, how you observe, how you navigate the world, who you are, as you navigate, how you change, or your heroes journey, or your heritage journey. The thing about, like, you know, I can have a girlfriend, hopefully not. Don't get one thing about wedding them, because Regency is like, I'm younger. So basically, you have, like, a flower, the bouquet, and someone took me a flower, I would dive. I'll dive away. Because, you know, I'm so poor, I don't want one kid. Because the thing about growing a flower over my head is I want to catch it. I don't catch any flowers for you, because, you know, then there's been another ladies coming from I said, I don't want you give me a house. That's a good council or not give me a house. So basically, I'm sitting that. Basically

Unknown Speaker  4:01  
here we're gonna do this properly. Now.

Unknown Speaker  4:06  
So so this video is very important to me. It means, it means hella loves me. So guys, please try to try to understand yourself first before you do it. So basically I define this is document here a persona, or the snapshot of the person's state. Like, you know, how they navigate that person, called being like, you know, the soul, the house of that person. It's like

Unknown Speaker  4:30  
a snapshot state. It's like, me mistake, Obi,

Unknown Speaker  4:35  
so this like, Here,

Unknown Speaker  4:37  
Mr. Obi. So basically, there's no persona. It's no persona, per se. It's no one esthetic persona. I'm seeing that persona is dynamic. So basically, it says here, how we act, how we interact, how we it's just a policy force, you know, for me, after the diver, like, you know, to have like a curly hair, you know, I don't like straight hair. I just.

Unknown Speaker  5:00  
Basically have to have, like, a way to protect myself to the industry and say, oh, yeah, he gets it, you know, because the person is not static. It's special about being you. You're very dynamic. You know, whether you are a military soldier or like a police officer or like a child with autism, with autism, it doesn't matter. You have something you are you want to show through, or how the world wants to see you. So you get to the gate, oh, that's what that means. No, she doesn't talk too much. So basically, what the persona means for me, what I showed you guys, I can't find anything, but the watch I have is like a Rolex, and it's broken down, but it's a fake one. It's like a Rolex. But you know, the Rolex

Unknown Speaker  5:40  
is like, that's like, my chains, this one machine. You know, that's like, the broken system wasn't a real low risk. Was like a rubber band, like a but I was like, like a broken one, and I like that one because it's better for me to have it. So basically, this is, like a persona. And the thing I'm saying is that it's very dark now, because I could get more change than anything. But the persona broke down because, you know, the, you know, the time difference around the Rolex I never had, which is afraid of fine stuff.

Unknown Speaker  6:08  
One of my other reasons, it is that. But, you know, I should you guys that. But the thing is, like everything, usually for the dinner, the road is broke down and it's crack on edge and everything, and we'll take anyways and get a new one, and that being a new persona, I sure, like a new robot, like a new like a wristband, but the wristband is like more of a sweatband,

Unknown Speaker  6:29  
basically. For me, basically, I put my watch inside my palm, so don't put it like here, like this. So for me, it's like time, you know, because, you know, it's like general, like a small one, she goes this way. You don't go this way because, you know, I have the other way. So basically, just look at it here, and let's, let's see all this thing about personas like me and my Instagram doesn't even understand videos. He's a very persona. Have you heard of the journey? Basically, the shooter person is your persona, like my one just shows you about me every day, my history, and it's like the Vermont one. Now, the real woman can be like, um, have you heard of Gen Z step? So guys, um, you know, for me, myself, basically here, but it's autistic, but you know how I work. Why did

Unknown Speaker  7:13  
you just buy a new house? Nnamdi, why don't you just buy a house? Nd, the council don't give me house. 2014, free health on the Health and Social Care Act. That's the kind of them are saying that the persona of them. So basically, when they look at you like this, and they

Unknown Speaker  7:30  
do that, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Don't talk about that. You know, it's not like, it's rude anything. Basically, audiences trade because there's a there's a there's a housing collapse, everything that's happened in UK, there's a lot of nonsense. That's what it is. A lot of people, women, have a lot of beautiful personas, but those pieces are iwutted because they didn't put their business really the rebellion against the makeup. So that's other persona. My sister's a tomboy. My she's a tomboy, but I don't say anything, but she's a tomboy. She's like a bar so she's just a tomboy, but she plays PS five, PS four, PS, three. She likes she's a draw, an art but she's not like such karate for Lady. And she's very small. He's a girl, actually, but she's not like the typical lady fairy guy, girl that has makeup. She'll beat your ass in chess. She's red smoke

Unknown Speaker  8:25  
and karate too. If you are her fries, everything gonna spar. So basically, so basically, how we communicate ourselves to the world, our internal state of mind to begin. So basically, the Julie, basically, imagine that there's a bank account. Julie, she's in. You just continue and she she's asking to communicate with someone that's new. You don't basically want to have sure there's no jargon, there's no dragons, no communication to Julian. What's gonna happen in the bank, you know, people's money at risk. The risk of Nico here is, like, you know, much the risk of this risk of DK, because you have to really coherently to mitigate risk, to ensure that she understands how to do bank financial transactions for new clients, etc, she has to look at how she can sustain herself like an E commerce class she can navigate with the human resources department, all that stuff, good stuff. Now we go to other one. So the old persona curated, or curated a new persona. So basically, from your old speech of mind, or whether you're who you are inside or you are, you have to reflect your curated persona to the outside world, like, you know, for example, my jersey stare is not it's not only because all the status may not know what that is, but I just may give it. Or me know what I say not give it. But you know, JC says like dad anyway. So if my friend do this, I'm saying, Why are you doing that? You know, my face, as you see my face, is like, I'm angry because I don't have house, and if I turn to the five, I will never get out. So what is just buy a house? Are you okay? Don't you know my struggles? You know those kind of things. The thing about creating persona, same thing there. It's like a buy diction at some.

Unknown Speaker  10:00  
Perfect. So I can say, let me go and try other kinds to get a house, but not give me a new persona. You know, I work with our own Council, but I can say all the signals to me, so I have a new persona. Obi means heart also. So my heart is not to break them, because I can rebellious. Rebelling The right way is my rebel. I see myself as rebel, but because I'm a rebel with hustle, so I can have an evil heart, a good heart, but, you know, I choose the good heart for my mental health, so I just sue people. You know, it's like a rebel, yes, let's say that no rebel. So basically, another one is like this. So basically he's got an old snail. The shell get too heavy for the old snail and get too dirty, get too ugly, get too smelly, the old snail has to then what, get a new shell. So basically, just to create curated find where there's a lot of shells,

Unknown Speaker  10:48  
or create a new shell entirely, or, like, find where there's no been any shells, have one there and put one all down. Find a shell there's some kind of, like a sun castle, and put on his back and does a new persona. And it's without sound Castle,

Unknown Speaker  11:05  
sand castle thing. And where is it? And this is the shell. It's good for it. You know, this is fine if it doesn't, and that's how that works. So that's the house. To me. It's basically the old shell is like the house room I'm in a room. I don't be in a room on a house. So after navigate this, navigate to buy a house, or, like, I just show everyone that's the best way to do it.

Unknown Speaker  11:28  
And then you get this

Unknown Speaker  11:30  
box. The box is the room. So basically, this box is no good to me. I don't want this box. I want a house. But the council don't give a house. Let's throw a council on the house. Actually, un Council, arena, Council, all of them, you know, the Manchester all of them are asked for to the job, you know, the barking Council, or do nothing. So I'm still in a box. But you know, I don't if I don't get about 25 years old, I would never get a house. 2014

Unknown Speaker  11:55  
my human rights, and I'll keep suing them.

Unknown Speaker  11:59  
Me, myself and I so basically, who are you? Who is me? Who am I? Okay? Am I me? Am I myself? Am I? Am I? How do I? How does me myself, doing this, become i? So if me is Uche, knowledge myself is power, and I become OB. So that's my three voices. But you know, I think it's true. But you know,

Unknown Speaker  12:19  
because three, you feel like two, because, you know, I took to myself, me myself, and usually my opportunity. I'm teaching myself, and I'm just thinking through so basically, I'm so open now just, I'm the first in my head. I talk to myself on time. You know, basically

Unknown Speaker  12:34  
this person, true positive, true negative, false positive. I'm forcing your session, which means like, Oh,

Unknown Speaker  12:42  
is it the personal but yes, is this the person I want to be? Do want to become this? Mr. Obi or behind, Mr. Heart or soul?

Unknown Speaker  12:51  
Yes, I have basically repeated myself. Now this question has to ask yourself, just search whether you want to be the new persona or keep your old one.

Unknown Speaker  13:01  
So you go like

Unknown Speaker  13:03  
force positive. Nnamdi, why Tarak? Basically on tonight, November 20 January, I was homeless on Mr.

Unknown Speaker  13:11  
Ademi evicted me from the care home. AK supported housing in

Unknown Speaker  13:15  
Tarak

Unknown Speaker  13:18  
become homeless on 29th of November, one week on the second and 23rd which is a Sunday, on Saturday, I raised my business, ob Nexus, Obi Nexus, which is under one

Unknown Speaker  13:30  
week, exactly one week, which is seven days tonight, if you calculate myself

Unknown Speaker  13:36  
today, nine minus Seven is what 22 basically on a Saturday, third one, then we

Unknown Speaker  13:47  
said, Oh no, I'm gonna sue, because, anyway, so I came out of homelessness being a house of tells,

Unknown Speaker  13:56  
10,000 pounds, basically, I paid them. I paid what I paid. I paid.

Unknown Speaker  14:04  
I went to Best Western.

Unknown Speaker  14:08  
I paid

Unknown Speaker  14:11  
770

Unknown Speaker  14:15  
732

Unknown Speaker  14:16  
pounds. No, no, that's in total, 362

Unknown Speaker  14:20  
No. 162 No,

Unknown Speaker  14:25  
over 300 pounds per week.

Unknown Speaker  14:30  
Basically, I paid over between a 700 No, wait,

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
302

Unknown Speaker  14:37  
pounds.

Unknown Speaker  14:40  
A

Unknown Speaker  14:43  
bigger fish, 362 pounds per day at the Best Western,

Unknown Speaker  14:48  
no per day, no per week, no per week at Best Western, that story is two pounds per week. I have 10,000 pounds over my bank account, which is my Halifax bank account, and my nationwide.

Unknown Speaker  15:00  
My business, I safe to go to Cambridge, Kent masters and PG, and then I lost that. So half the month I went to my friend's house, like, what's his name? Because, you know, they don't want my money. The customer gave me, I'll say, I call them city council, don't pay for you being in a hotel ever. So they said to me, but she had to move from here. They said, didn't know me. The Council. Council didn't know me. They're not done. So basically, I had to go from there. Could a council reception? They do. They do want to give me a house. So I call the council. You want to give me house, basically? And the council said, no, no, we don't know him. That's correct counsel. We don't know who he is, everything. So they said they can't keep me because you cannot pay. I'm not willing to pay because I'm homeless as well. So they don't do anything, because they're just a business. You know, if you go to anywhere, you never money, it's a business anyway. So you're gonna understand you can't be there

Unknown Speaker  15:50  
by law, or let's start become incriminating. So basically, I then moved to from

Unknown Speaker  15:57  
then I moved to Edward's house. Mr. Edward has a property in the property where he's gonna get a house now, but he's not allowed that don't give me a house. It said to me, I stayed there for one two days, today and yesterday, and then I moved to premier in 2062 pounds. I paid

Unknown Speaker  16:20  
a permit in for the rather half to three months, 1.5 months each, but paid for the for the day, not the week. So the week, two pounds per day, I lost that for the 100%

Unknown Speaker  16:34  
they lost several million of our taxpayers money. And you know, again, issue, I became the rebel, the rebel. Obi the heart. You know that's I'm suing them for 60 million standard what I'm doing. So that's why my persona message to me, because it's more than it's more than being a physical body. It doesn't it's not more about my anger. Because, you know, if I just be I didn't do nothing, I didn't get home, just died. Be honest. You know, I'll just die because, you know, my parents just pay for the house anyway, because the council's gonna help me. The problem with the council is, like, the business sign they don't like me. But, you know, that's the problem. They wanted criminal

Unknown Speaker  17:13  
room. Could just put me in a house and then switch my intelligence everything. So I did. The thing about this is, like it just goes Nigerian dynamics, and that's how we do in Nigeria and then Nigerians.

Unknown Speaker  17:24  
But you know, either make the rules, this is how they are.

Unknown Speaker  17:28  
So doesn't seem to it's like, it's very disgusting, actually, but that's why you need to shape. You understand your persona, how to cultivate creative position. It's up to you. It's not one or the other for you. It's up to you, how you do it, you know, how you solve your problem. The thing is about the personal development of it is like static. It's just you in a snapshot. It's not just for your state of mind, who you are. I can change my name to I can be a persona program

Unknown Speaker  17:56  
or an avatar, like, you know, avatars like a Karina, or like winter, or like,

Unknown Speaker  18:00  
black, pink, Lisa, Jenny, John Cook,

Unknown Speaker  18:05  
G Dragon, all these people are avatars, because they show to the good example, they're like models, you know, they're great. They're basically a persona that people either, oh, I want to be like that guy has money, no, because, you know, they have some kind of flair to them, and really, really resonates with people, which is an avatar, basically, avatars, like phone that resonates with people. You know, I could be the pros guy and then shoot controversial network avatar. I think my avatar already, but, you know, that's my persona right now, because the people want to talk to my persona, that's the avatar, you know, like, you know, the famous, rich people in the past are there. The Queen is not avatar for me anyway. So basically, it's like being yourself, authentically, showing this coherence amongst your skill of mind, who you are, your essence. Because again, the human rights laws, everything don't mean anything to me, because, you know, they just paperwork, and it's no law and order in our forces. Basically, you got a lot of laws, but the order's not there. So that's why still have this persona, because I can, I've been to Manchester, I've been to Kent, I've been to

Unknown Speaker  19:08  
Cambridge. I just for, like, getting my, get my, my stuff, sort of this year for my campus, I mean,

Unknown Speaker  19:17  
but I couldn't do for the basically, next year, if I go to Cambridge, the funeral, which was 1000 for Masters and PhD, 2000 pounds. But, you know, I'm here. So basically, I started my muscle informally, all by myself, because I don't want to give up on my dream building the directed symbiotic evolution computer speculation of computers that will adapt, and the ontological Bayesian intelligence infrastructure, AI systems that will cost us some that know them stiff. They know their themselves more than others.

Unknown Speaker  19:49  
One more thing to write down. So basically, the thing about this, so basically, when you listen to basically when I get to an adult, you know, my pursuit gonna change all the time, like it's not really dynamic to say this is precisely OB.

Unknown Speaker  20:03  
Uh, frankly, strange monster, or like, you know, that man, he has one good side, one battle, but, you know, that's day and night, good and bad. But it's not true. It's not like, um, bad his persona, he says, the persona disorder, you know, he doesn't know who he is, you know, doesn't know how what he wants. Because, no, he's for sure, it's not well developed. He can't navigate systems enough, and that's what the fellow law magicalism principles meant to address. So basically, I won't move to fly. I can modify myself to get with

Unknown Speaker  20:34  
now. Now say I want to, want to make love to my my girlfriend. I didn't, don't like to look at my my seam, and I want to feel authentic. So my girlfriend likes what the color is, magenta, opportunity. So such colors magenta. So when I make when I have love with her, make love of that I have to go through modification of my body. Pierre says, anything to give to show myself like to her, like this, Why watch basically my scene to magenta, fluorescent, and then we make love and have an authentic relationship. It's not about, like, even a change of my body, you know?

Unknown Speaker  21:08  
No, no, I don't want the children to have, like, semen that were magenta or look weird or not because they have cancer that I said, No, you know, because it's a mutual relationship between me and my partner, or, God, for whatever that person is, it's because I'm in love. Excuse me. Love is me. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in love, but I believe they're like healing and transformation and change and new beginnings. You know, because that's all scientifically grounded already, unless we give me a formula to love, then see what I can, speed up, mitigation, decoherence. Okay, next one.

Unknown Speaker  21:45  
Why persona develop? Why? Basically, why persona should never be static. Basically,

Unknown Speaker  21:52  
got family dynamics, social dynamics, all of that. So family damage just means, like my family's harassing me, bullying me, like, you know, making me feel like annoying about the family. The dynamic is just the like, small basically, the frame is dynamic. You don't know what's gonna happen. You know, basically, you just tune your dynamic to the environment. And that's why they got, like, a social dynamic. Your friends issues where we have, you know, your friend been a gun George, you know, for one week you don't know these guys. Fine. Now and then they lose your God to give Academy. And you know, no gun. He brings the car he should bomb the next week. You don't know him, you know. And he bombs people you know, family, your mom says to you, seek a medication like me. I'll make you homeless

Unknown Speaker  22:37  
before the game institution for one year. Money dynamics, you lose 10,000 pounds, financial damage, you know, all that things you know, use the standard communication dynamics. You know people don't listen to you because you are autistic, or you have a problem. You're

Unknown Speaker  22:51  
flexible, etc. So the thing is, like

Unknown Speaker  22:54  
putting on your yourself, preserving yourself. What is the preserve yourself like? Preserve yourself from moving the marks moving, whatever the barrier is, you know the marks, you know whether it's coming from someone else or not. So you got authentic anchor. Basically, I'm

Unknown Speaker  23:10  
just the obi. So this anchor here, the heart you see here, is like the authentic anchor for me. So basically, my aura shows all my drawings, all my stuff. I show that even this work I did, Freedom bird, Freedom bird, and then it's like a freedom bird is like a drain. I did hope of BF, the

Unknown Speaker  23:32  
oral silk. You see this, I just drew down, just thinking in there, just like

Unknown Speaker  23:37  
they're not useful. Igbo, pattern two. This line is all mine. This is my king in Nigeria. But, you know, I'm a boyfriend. But you know, if I return to the fire, I should go back to my land, the oral cell, one system sells build your own like, you know, as a child, I navigate to the broken systems, reflection and a mirror of an adult, I return as a king and an adult, another king, and it goes a busy piece of technique. I used to write it because, you know, to technique, you know, like you can replace each and every word. I can make sense, like, as a as good as Grace Hopper, you know, I did it. Basically, my struggle is my beginning, middle and end journey. Basically, you go all of this here I got my wing product, you know, wing because I believe in wings change.

Unknown Speaker  24:22  
Like other stuff I did here,

Unknown Speaker  24:28  
all of that, you know, the thing about me is also navigated. So after change, after having you soft to, you know, understand why I'm being fragmented. So, basically, one more thing.

Unknown Speaker  24:39  
So basically, the thing is, like, when you see someone dreadlocks, you know, plain and boring, you say, don't say you don't say you

Unknown Speaker  24:48  
don't say, like, Oh, you're powered, you know, don't say that, you know, because dreadlock is like, really good. If you say, like, Oh, you got, you got nice hair. You got nice thread about, how about dreadlocks? You know, what do you like us or not? But you.

Unknown Speaker  25:00  
Don't say, instinctively, say your face with a gang, you know, unless you know that that is a gang you know. Don't say that. You know. They don't interpret or miss it. To try even interpret, you know, just good to ask people that how they got their identity, what this means to them, how they navigate it. Is the history behind it, you know. What have you? You have nice clothes so you don't have nice clothes, so you're poor, you know, you don't maybe I'm in charity.

Unknown Speaker  25:26  
In my world opinion, you see someone put on one color because my trouser work and I put on something. Don't do the basically, don't buy, don't just someone, you know, someone's or, you know, look at someone like individuals. You know, try to look at someone as individuals, not like the same individual, or just have to look at them with equity, at the minimum equity. And the individual, you know, they have an objective to doing that thing is but basically, I'm seeing your physical body. It's not your mind, you know, your physical body, your mind is not your physical body. The relay information. They work together, but they're all the same. You know, you don't do that. Okay? So basically this, I'm saying to you the statement of

Unknown Speaker  26:06  
the second. So the statement of the information is like the statement especially intent. The song states, what they say, how they show basically, how they show themselves, statement they make, the fashion statement, the family statement only they make. Yes or no, you can never just know the special, the model, whatever they express the object or the properties they show

Unknown Speaker  26:25  
when they do that statement, then least intent. Basically, this is a nice cloud. What am I trying to express? What should I mean? You know, the intent, why they're doing this, the application, the objective, the use, the purpose, the criteria, what they try to do to you, to observe them, whether they must be or not. You know, it's about being authentic. If not authentic, then the whole family just falls apart for them. It's like it's not working for them, so just making them do

Unknown Speaker  26:55  
it. It's like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  26:58  
for my sister to play, my sister my sister, to ever do wrong for herself, because, you know she's not doing right. And then the bubble of a magical, um, basically, yes, can't do something because, you know, she'll get agitated, she'll get stressed, and then she'll, she'll then rebel against you, my sister. She's rebels against me. She was like, once, it's rebel, but I stopped, stop rebelling because I stopped telling her, and also becoming good friends, you know. And then, you know. And then we started doing each other, but she grew out of that state of mind,

Unknown Speaker  27:25  
but she didn't really

Unknown Speaker  27:27  
share the own authentic persona. At the end of the day,

Unknown Speaker  27:30  
the bubble,

Unknown Speaker  27:33  
okay? Basically something called, I called the bubble or phenomenon principle.

Unknown Speaker  27:39  
Basically, this one is the one in the real world. Let me get to it here.

Unknown Speaker  27:45  
So basically, for me, right now, I'm always observing the world. This is called the type a bubble. So this way you're outside the wood, like, you know, outside your precursor state this morning in real world. But you know, you're observing, you're not being harmed. So basically this, like accelerometer runs in principle or EEG model. But the thing about this, it's like the bubble is like, you me observing everything around me without getting harmed. You know, it's like I'm observing everything I'm not getting punched. But you know, when I start to get angry or start to fight, no, basically it's like a training ground for my mind. You know, it's like a simulation. But my bubble keeps growing and growing and growing, because the more I know, the more the outside world I can navigate it. There's no harm that comes to the bubble, because it doesn't affect my state of mind, my being. It's really this type. Is a type of phenomenological, phenomenological, phenomeological, perceptional membrane. It's like, it's something illogical, means, like, person to person in various

Unknown Speaker  28:45  
ppm, perceptive, like the one I'm seeing observation, you know, based on, basically, I'm observing a state like 5% of the time, and then I'm consuming, I'm using that information to act, you know, this I call an actor model, or witnessing, witnessing actor. I witness something, and then I do it. I don't want something, then I don't do it. And do it. But, you know, it's gonna bug grow my knowledge, my power, what I do, who I am in life, what I want to be like. You know, there's no harm basically, to me, but I'll just bend down. This is like being a movie. Basically, I can be homeless and be the most disgusting person ever, and no one will harm me. Because, you know, they they rather run away from me than harm me, because there's no point of harming me. Because on the street, yes, but you know, there's no one's harming me because I was a direct threat to them. I was just observing, doing my own business. They were not homeless, you know, they were just saying, This guy's showering everything. I didn't look like the problem. I was just like homeless. But, you know, I do want to give a fight that I was in trouble. I was in distress, you know, which is part of this book, too. So your thing is, you're gonna learn. Basically, it's a painful hostels now, hotels. Now I pay for hostels when I went for hospitals, when I went to Cambridge, because the hospitals were more sustainable for me, and I started learn more.

Unknown Speaker  30:00  
Sort of people hotels, you know, which is her life's best set. I lost 10,000 pounds, and they're like, they didn't care. I didn't want to give my money. But, you know, that's what I'm saying to you, just like the thing. So as long as you learn to involve principle, Chris's bubble, when I'm bombed, it's like, post conscious. Like, that's what I call a post conscious model. So there's no harm here. The goal is to grow this bubble indefinitely, obviously. And then this one is pre conscious, like, you know, this blood application, that's a pre conscious one. So basically, it's a baby in a womb, and that's like the fetus, which is the membrane, phenological lensing, membrane, PRP, a principal member. So the principle of this is the observable thing that's happening, like in a bird being born in the waves and seen everything. You know, I've been in my mom's room and everything. But, you know, the thing that's about my mom, I think my mom, my mom, was not special. Fuck my mom. I hate that purpose. But, you know, the thing about this is that, um, the pre birth face, that for me, I see everything I navigated my consciousness. I know I was going over. And he really minds, I think. But you know, because the information, the bremberg was the features, the model, you know, and you know sure that you know the information doesn't declare, because you just preserve there's no kicking physically on the outside because you're pregnant woman. There's no
