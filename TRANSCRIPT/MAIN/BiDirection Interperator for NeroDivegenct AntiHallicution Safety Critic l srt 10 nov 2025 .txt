1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay, remember this video is on a PRP anthological Bayesian intelligence system, so I've got this video already, but I think I lost it.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So, what is PRP? PSP stands for Phenomological Lens and Principle, or Phenomagical Lens and Portugal.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's really means anthological Bayesian intelligence, if it's actually true, but my PSG is anthological Bayesian infant intelligence.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But, you know, that is smart stuff. The term anthological, the nature of knowing itself, you know, knowing yourself, you know, who you are.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You know, you'll be afraid of history. Okay, anthological, who, what, why, when, why, you know, how to build your stuff.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So, anthological means, like, role, you know, I know my goal, I know my purpose, I know what to do next.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, the Bayesian is like a probability of it. Bayesian inference, like, you know, half and half on the Bayesian graph.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, it's not about Bayesian. It's like, you know, it gets an approach of range, you know, that can be something to be in the 0.5 to 0.9.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But that's what the function is called, he runs, and the function works, and I think works.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's Bayesian inference. Intelligence, AI intelligence, smart devices, things that don't need consciousness, model, you know, my lead architectural system architect, ontological Bayesian reasoning, probability.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Rhetical origin of work, you know, for AI systems, you know, it gives that to ensure an AI and ex-registration based on real time.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, when something is an educate, the rhetoric means, like, you know, my rhetorical reason, like, you know, it's just talk, but it means something, it hasn't rounded.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But, you know, it's not practical, maybe practical, yes, it can be practical, definitely.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But, you know, it's something like an educate's memory really encountered, you know, it's something that's absorbed that, you know, by itself.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And that's what the rhetorical reasoning, rhetoric reasoning, rationale, like, you know, the rationale behind doing that.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, I changed the question, you know, the goal is to define the standards of the ABC.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Like, now, the goal of this is to have a dual model, observe the consumer.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, now, remember guys, the observer model, just what numbers are they, you know, almost up errors.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It doesn't propagate any errors.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's also the source code error.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's just an error loop is witnessing all the time for the state.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It changed based on local matter and local minima.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So, one of the problems observed is states.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's really observing the local minima, the changes.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It does, and what it does, what's going to change, what's going to change, you know, I think change wants to be changed.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like, it's like a complex, it's just what this is.

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go with this.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So, when it witnesses, the type of the poor for the time, it then acts as a factor for the time.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Because that's the thing, like, the 5.4 is just a standard system.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But the 6.4.5 is just the other one.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, this is like a, the system has been interpreted.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The PhD on direct instruction, on direct representative systems.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which are two things, same thing.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Observe the consumer.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Observe the consumer in content systems, you know.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We can't really observe, we want to change the content states.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Help the PhD scholars.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So, basically, then add, let me suppose it.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, you don't want to have a interpreter state, you know, mangoes or roundgoats, you know.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or else it's so basically, other system interpreters.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Any partner, partner, polygots and interpreters, must, you know, you must be working with the Gossi, a manuscript.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Gossi, Gossi, GSS manuscripts, GSS, the Gossi Lang, a polygots manuscript.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, no, the manuscript, I don't really define properly, but you know, we need this communication for interpreters.

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Because interpreters, for Python, they're in the parts of the lower accession.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The goal of this is to observe that the interpreter, for the system, is the form of the geosystem.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We are a Gossi Lang polygots manuscript, the GSM files.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The GSS files for Gossi Lang.

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Now, the Gossi Lang files are just a polygots files.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's just like a polygots.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So, the goal of this is to have the GSS files, the GSM files, which is interpreter state.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay, now, look example.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So, Python can define something called bi-weekly, once in every two weeks, you know, once every two weeks.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So, once, you know, is it once of every two weeks or once bi-weekly?

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, the ambiguity in the term bi-weekly or bi-deally, let's just bi-deally, is bi-weekly once in two weeks.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know, something happens in one week, every two weeks, one in, in, but then it's off, one off.

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One every time, once off two weeks, you know, that's the thing.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Every once a week, you do skip two weeks, you do it, don't do it for two weeks.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Every one in the two weeks, you know, the interpretation is all off, you know, it's like an in-off loop, you know.

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's the bi-weekly or bi-deally interpreter.

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So, Python mind interprets one way, and the new one, I suppose, all the way.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You know, based on whatever the standard specification is, because these are interpreted languages, not compound,

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
that execute as you run it, they're not compound, they have a runtime to al-bye-bye in the robot.

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And just I'm saying, the goal of this is just to have a system.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Stand this concept, and I can refer from the new algorithm to three AVL nodes, three AVL red-black animation.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Which red-black animation is just a standard algorithm?

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
To animate what the red-red-red nodes from a system that needs blackberries, you know.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
As I said, you know, the red-red condition is just the current standard for it.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Now, for the quantum computers, you're going to understand that the observer, the consumer modern,

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
hired another hooker attached.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So, for example, if you observe, you think, but you know, the observer, you can't observe a state,

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and change something in quantum computing.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We observe something in the quantum system, so you have to ensure that you can act before you can, you know, consume.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So, for example, you know, I'm thinking like, so for example, if I'm observing, I then have a pre-observ module,

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
pre-observ, like, you know, something like a pre-event, a bubbler, a vent loop, that way, this is so.

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When a pre-event, when an event, a pre-event happens before another event, that's the dual-it acts on that event.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So, because the system needs the next state of that event.

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So, you can create the formation, you can get the formation you need before you ever observe,

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
or you can get the observer you run the code act, because she before the function, call-up, call-lead uses it.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now, we got, so go and make tricks, 0, 0, 1, 3, end off.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, you got that code, end off.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah, just, you just remember four, four in-loop, four of-loop.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You know, you just turn the loops for the interpretation layer.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can try to understand this more formally, to ensure that the system understands the concept,

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and concept, and can resolve itself based on the evaluation,

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
and for that set structure, the bi-quakey,

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
we are a bi-dag.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay, now, very important, the bi-dag stands for bi-right-directional-dag.

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's like a, it's a bit of the, these are interpreted, but most of the contents.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So, anything that's interpreted has two states, you know, can be either one state or the other state.

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So, it's kind of weird to, you have to retreat, you have to ensure that the system is flexible.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, the thing about the bi-interpreter, or the bi-terpreter,

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is that they have a bi-directional, bi-directional intuition,

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and can mean one thing, for one system, another thing, another system.

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But, you know, that's what's called humans about them.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It reminds me of EI-association system.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It can stop, and EI hallucinates with this framework, too.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, this is important.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So, if you go to github.com slash O-G-H-E-Drive,

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or like a drive, you know, I think that means like a road drive, yeah.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So, it's an Apple drive version.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But, you know, that would drive the, for the EI system.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So, you get like a very important contents.

104
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So, basically, the, how this intuition stops EI from working, from working,

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
incrementing is this.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, remember those things you did at school.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
About, 20 equals 8.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
285 equals, or, or, actually, it's, 25 equals 10.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And, 6 equals 3.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What is five equals?

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Next.

112
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So, this is just an implementation.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This has got my anti-AR hallucination system.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So, basically, this 10, this is a system of linear equation.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But, you know, the goal is for you to understand what's happening here.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, you see 8 equals 20 equals 8.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is, in fact, this is just one system of linear equations.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But, you know, it's like a puzzle, really.

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a puzzle.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's like, in all this puzzle that gives you 20 equals 8.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It means, more systems 20 is once 8.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You know, no one's 8.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So, it's a layer between, when you have an 18 and a pattern file,

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
or, number, it's, you know, what is 8 meter?

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's 20 in, like, a lower, or, see.

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You know, 20 in lower.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Uh, lower, in lower.

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because, lower is the interpretive limit.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So, when you have it in a 5 and a lower, you have a 10 in pattern.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When you have a 6 and a lower, you have 3.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And, then, we have 5 in the pattern, uh, lower.

132
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You have, um, x.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But, what is x?

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We don't know x.

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The goal of this thing is to ensure that the AI or systems

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
that are active never hallucinate, uh,

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
on makeup or their own interpretation, uh, of that associated,

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
it means to resolve the, um, bi-directional, bi-directional,

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
uh, director is said to be graph, uh, with, uh,

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
urban access, territorial tracing system,

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to trace all the sequences, uh, and the series of function calls.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
recursively, uh, no, because of the, but, you know, to resolve in a circular dependency,

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to ensure that, you know, every, the, the president has a, you, uh, telemetry ID.

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Uh, what is it called a unique user ID?

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Uh, for that local, uh, local maximum scope,

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
local minimum scope, based on what is allowed to access you.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now, this puzzle can be, your message is, well, it can be like a square,

148
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
okay, either for, like, you know, this is like, uh, a cube,

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
or it can be a mathematical geometry, you know,

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
this is, uh, represent, uh, uh, two, uh, two, uh, two, uh, two, uh,

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
two land, you know, two land, you know, two layers, uh, two, two land,

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
you know, this is like, uh, you know, example,

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
auxiliary constructions, you know, they, um,

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
geometrically, uh, originally, you know, these, you make, just solve the problem, you know,

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
and this, um, this puzzle is, this, um, either geometric, uh,

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
generic, uh, zero puzzles, which I call them,

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
they're geometric, uh, uh, uh, uh, geometric, uh, uh, uh,

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
algebraic, uh, geometric, uh, because, you know,

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
there can be, in the form of, uh, uh, uh, graph or diagram,

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
like this, it can be form of anything else.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Uh, can I, um, read your one post?

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now, I'm going to take a picture.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Okay.

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So this is a puzzle here. It can be a puzzle here.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But the thing about this number system is, you know,

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
this number system is no universal.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We've never seen, uh, the number, uh, uh, uh,

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
what is the universal concept?

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know, it's a concept we usually never,

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but we've never seen an action number nine,

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
uh, because the number nine in front of French,

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you know, we've seen the number nine in front, uh,

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
uh, Bay, say, uh, FJ, that's it.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But, you know, because we've seen the number, uh,

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
three in real life, um, working about, you know,

176
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
hi, I'm a number three, you know,

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
uh, you know, and then I'm the only number three,

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you know, I use it as number one, uh,

179
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
dot, what? Even seen two, uh, three,

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the number two, uh, you know,

181
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
two, uh, in front, you know,

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
this belt and French way, you know,

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
working about is not an abstract concept.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You know, that's what I'm saying.

185
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This system must remain coherent by the way, the model.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And this is why the PLP, uh,

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
mother, uh, for a touch, good vision,

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
information.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So my goal is to ensure this works coherently.

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can trust you, um, say that, you know, this, uh,

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
this is just a puzzle, yes.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But, you know, this can mean, uh,

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
should you measure alignment or system?

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's for air anti-air solution.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So I'm going to try to anti-air,

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
essentially, air cannot cancelates

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and interpret, uh, here interpretation.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Um, um, um, too much interpretation.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Um, uh, aka, so, um,

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
um, so basically, the,

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
the data about this is the,

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
the data, so remove a vector,

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
uh, bi-weekly, bi-dealy,

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
uh, and ensure it's a bi-dack,

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
uh, bi, bi-organized operational system back.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, the sequence of instructions,

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
uh, signal series of steps, um,

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
a sequence is just a non-automated series,

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
but, you know, a series is what can alternate,

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
uh, it can split between interpretation,

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you know, based on context.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Uh, with context-fishing,

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
uh, but, you know, context-fishing,

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
not code-fishing, uh,

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
because you know, switching context based on the users' needs,

216
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you know, inputs.

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Um, now, uh, this is part of the FUNCTA frameworks.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Uh, FUNCTA frameworks.

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now, FUNCTA frameworks is very important for this,

220
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
because, you know, those are the mappings for the system.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If everything is a FUNCTA in an infrastructure,

222
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
then you can evolve it.

223
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's, yep.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's seamlessly.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's not easy.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Because it's just like,

227
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
it's like a new component,

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you know, it can be a new component.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Uh,

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
if you're normalizing from a new protocol,

231
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
consume it to observer, you know,

232
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
it can be resolved like,

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
it can go for, uh,

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
observe the consumer,

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
consume it to observer,

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
observe the consumer,

237
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and in any way, ship you want.

238
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Uh, but the goal is to resolve the state of mind,

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
you know, okay.

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Uh, FUNCTA, um,

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So, PIP objective, uh,

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
of PIP framework.

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Now, PIP stands for,

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
just like example here.

245
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Uh, you can see this, uh, PIP.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Uh, so basically, uh,

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
PIP stands for,

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Phenomaginian principle.

249
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How?

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now, how, therefore,

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
homogeneous,

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
uh, home.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We have called it,

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
HM homogeneous.

255
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Now, you see this data is 00.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Here, this one is uniform.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This one is uniform.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This one is uniform.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It goes like 00.

260
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So, this is an input to the matrix,

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
00.

262
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Now, I think it's another matrix.

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It gets 00.

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It gets a matrix,

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
it gets c, or it gets more,

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you know, it gets more,

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
it gets more,

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,000


269
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
you know, it gets more,

270
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
you get more,

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
you get more.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Same, you know,

273
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
same.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And this is PIP.

275
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He is just data.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But, you know, it can be,

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
so you can be anything,

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
but it's just a standard form.

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now,

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
anything that's inputs to this matrix,

281
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
is the inputs.

282
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It can be an effective,

283
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
uh,

284
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
spots.

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It can be, you know,

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
the same form.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,000


288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
um,

289
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
um,

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
depending on how you wanna use it.

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You know,

292
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
how the data is structured,

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
how you want to best address the graph

294
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000


295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
structure,

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
uh, if it's a Virginia's data,

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
inputs, uh, you know,

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that seems uniform,

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and can be, um,

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
uh, can be, um,

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
modeled quickly.

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Uh, this comes with a different spot.

303
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
So, this spot,

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
uh, concept is okay.

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If I want to model some information,

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
uh, in a uniform manner,

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
you know, I'll define the uniform,

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
then, uh, input,

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
uh, as the model,

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
in a model.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Because, you know,

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
if I have, like, uh,

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
a structure for, uh,

314
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
a person,

315
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Eastern ID,

316
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
uh, I don't mix it with student,

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
uh,

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
uh,

319
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
credit card, a bank card,

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
because, you know,

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
that's not,

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you identify all the students,

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
but, you know,

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
if I have a student number,

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
student number,

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
student name,

327
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
student name,

328
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
uh, is me,

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
first name is Namji,

330
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
uh, Namji,

331
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
second name is Upala,

332
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and then DOB is my term,

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this is not,

334
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
this is a uniform data,

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
because, um,

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
this uniform stream of information,

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
just, uh, first name is what, uh,

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
a string, uh,

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and then the second name is a string,

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and the date of the birth is 19 to the main.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Now, this, uh,

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
applies to all homogeneous data,

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but, you know,

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
if I then have, um,

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
uh, if I was just not a uniform,

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
after, after,

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
after,

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
after I got a unique key,

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
uh, which is called a key,

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
uh, foreign key,

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
uh,

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
uh, foreign key,

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
uh, the foreign key,

354
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
uh, in it, uh,

355
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,000


356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
uh,

357
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,000


358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
foreign key,

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
uh,

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
foreign visit,

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and I put that there,

362
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and therefore,

363
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
this is a key,

364
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you can use,

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
to go on the next student ID,

366
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
uh,

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
but, you know,

368
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
if it's not,

369
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
if it's not,

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
if it's like,

371
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
uh,

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
if it's the information,

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
it's not coherent,

374
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can get, like,

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
uh,

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
so this one's more uniform,

377
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
because, you know, it has,

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
uh, it's,

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
it represents a student,

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
enough about a student,

381
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
a student name,

382
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
and number,

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
they have a border,

384
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
a student name,

385
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
it's like Namji,

386
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and, uh,

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
the other name is Trink,

388
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
but, you know,

389
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
that's just one side of the uniform,

390
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
there's two strings there,

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
now, the,

392
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
what is it called?

393
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What is it called?

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Um, a uniform,

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
because it has its two strings there,

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
that's the first thing we're gonna do,

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
but,

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it makes it more uniform,

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
because the data belt is,

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
oh, sorry,

401
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it's a string,

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
so it's a uniform,

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
so, you know,

404
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
you put it in a 19th,

405
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
in November,

406
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
uh, if I put it in 2001,

407
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
uh, so 19th of May,

408
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
it's a one,

409
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that's uniform,

410
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
because the old strings,

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
now, if I ever put my age there,

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
uh, my age train four years old,

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
uh,

414
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and then, uh,

415
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
age train four years old,

416
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that is because of no uniform data,

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
because, you know,

418
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
there's something there,

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
the data is no uniform,

420
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
you know,

421
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
you can put in another data structure,

422
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
oh, we can handle it another way,

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but, you know, that data,

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
uh, can be something else,

425
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you can,

426
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
it's structured,

427
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
the more the structure,

428
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
but, uh,

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
spores,

430
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
locality,

431
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
because, you know,

432
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't need it,

433
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if I want to define a function now,

434
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
after either,

435
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
and this model doesn't need the age,

436
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
it doesn't have to need,

437
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
at the age, you know,

438
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you don't need it at all,

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
so you just need to discard the age,

440
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
you know,

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
it doesn't need it,

442
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you know,

443
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
you can define it

444
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
between a fountain,

445
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
uh, you can define a,

446
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
uh, a structure,

447
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
there are handles,

448
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
the names,

449
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
the string data type,

450
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and, uh,

451
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
and the names,

452
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and the numbers,

453
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
you know,

454
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
this is called a schema,

455
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
this is what the openness of schema is about.

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay.

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Now, the schema,

458
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
openness is the services,

459
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
uh, that's operation,

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
but open access,

461
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
but, uh,

462
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
division,

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but department,

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
but county,

465
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
so basically,

466
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
that schema is a diagram,

467
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
bi-dag resolution,

468
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
uh,

469
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
for the, uh,

470
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
cane cluster,

471
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
of the search engine.

472
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So basically,

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
you can search for, um,

474
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
uh, plasma,

475
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
uh,

476
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
services,

477
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
plasma systems,

478
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
uh,

479
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that operation,

480
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
uh,

481
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
bring, um,

482
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000


483
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
okay,

484
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
this is the okay services,

485
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
bring computing interfaces,

486
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
uh, plasma,

487
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
plasma,

488
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
plasma systems,

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
plasma,

490
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
plasma systems,

491
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
uh,

492
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
like in a plasma technology,

493
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
uh,

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
that's, uh,

495
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
open access,

496
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
uh,

497
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that's department,

498
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
the department is, uh,

499
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
uh,

500
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
sales department,

501
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
and, uh,

502
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
division,

503
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
uh,

504
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
computing,

505
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that, uh,

506
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
county,

507
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
uh,

508
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
county,

509
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
uh,

510
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
county,

511
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
uh,

512
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
county,

513
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000

515
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
uh,

516
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
uh,

517
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000


518
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000


519
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,000


520
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
uh,

521
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:29,000
uh,

522
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:54,000
uh,

523
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:19,000
