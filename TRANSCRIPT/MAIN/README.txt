# OBINexus Tiers: Constitutional Business Plan README

## Overview
Welcome to the **OBINexus Tiers Constitutional Business Plan** – a sovereign framework for building self-sustaining, human-centric ecosystems rooted in Igbo/Biafran ontology, phenomenological qualia, and 4D-to-3D lensing principles. This is **not a service, consultancy, or build-for-you product**. It's **your blueprint to BUILD YOUR OWN** – democratizing access to constitutional tech, housing designs, and evolutionary infrastructure without intermediaries.

**Date:** November 2, 2025 (v1.0)  
**Author:** Nnamdi Michael Okpala (OBINexus Founder)  
**License:** Public Domain for Open Access Tier (T1); Restricted to Business Access Tier (T2) for commercial adaptation. No derivatives without explicit alignment gating.  
**Repo:** [github.com/obinexus/obinexus-tiers-constitutional-business-plan](https://github.com/obinexus/obinexus-tiers-constitutional-business-plan)  
**Core Mantra:** *Live. Work. Breathe. Build Your Own. No Fragmentation. No Starvation.*

This README doubles as a **shareable blog post template** for LinkedIn, Medium, and Dev.to. Copy-paste it directly (adapt the intro for platform tone). It explains the tiers, clarifies boundaries (especially T3A/T3B), and gates access to prevent misuse. Share to amplify: tag #OBINexus #BuildYourOwn #ConstitutionalTech #BiafraRebirth.

## 🚀 The Vision: Why OBINexus Tiers?
In a world of fragmented systems – colonial topologies, neurotypical rigidity, and institutional gaslighting – OBINexus Tiers is a **constitutional reset**. It's not about handouts or hired builds; it's about **sovereign evolution**. 

- **Problem:** Ecosystems fail generations (25+25 years) through deliberate defragmentation: no housing sovereignty, no qualia coherence, no 2:1 zygote mapping for stability.
- **Solution:** A 3-tier + access model where you **access tools, align via gating, and build your compound/home/business**. Powered by bubble qualia theory, sparse 2-table encoding, and UC-time (consensual time) protocols.
- **Outcome:** Heal the rupture. Transcend the Juggernaut. From embryo to elder: stable bubbles, no collapse.

**Key Metrics for Coherence:**
- 95.4% knowledge-to-power handshake (UCH model: 75% knowledge → 25% power exchange).
- 100% DAG resolution for evolution (major.minor.patch + hot-swap LTS/experimental).
- No GMOs, no external builds – symbiotic, direct.

This plan is **own technology for OBINexus**: Evolved from my PhD roadmap (me, myself, I – ontological phenomenology). It's for Igbos/Biafrans first, but open to all who align.

## 📊 The Tiers: Access, Not Assistance
OBINexus operates on **gated alignment**: Ask the four questions at birth (via diares entry protocol: github.com/obinexus/diares). No paywalls, but no free rides. We provide schemas, matrices, and blueprints – **you execute**.

| Tier | Access Level | Focus | What You Get | Boundaries |
|------|--------------|-------|--------------|------------|
| **T1: Open Access** | Public (GitHub, YouTube, TikTok) | Neurodivergent/Neurotypical Duality | - Bubble Qualia Theory docs<br>- Sparse Matrix Projections (4D→3D lensing)<br>- Housing Designs (Live-Work-Breathe Zones)<br>- Pandora's Box Oral Seals (personal reflection tools) | Free read-only. No builds, no support. Share & adapt ethically. |
| **T2: Business Access** | Registered Schema (Lisa handshake) | Sovereign Compounds & Operations | - Full IWU OHA Constitution (public law for Biafra Terrace)<br>- BlueShare Protocol (Bluetooth+ for 10-20 person events)<br>- PRP Framework (Phenomenological Observe-See-Act)<br>- 24-Year Patent Cycles (2073 ban on non-compliant councils) | **Business-only**: Align via 75/25 power exchange. No T3 access. We don't build for you – ever. |
| **T3A: Knowledge Projects** | Gated (Coherence Test: 95.4%) | R&D Evolution | - Semantic Version X (hot-swap DAGs for infra-as-service)<br>- Rainforest S95 (95% reforestation metrics)<br>- Qualia Membrane Diagrams (bubble stability) | **Constitutional Tech Only**: No business, no monetization. Knowledge for alignment, not profit. Access via UCH handshake. |
| **T3B: Safety Critical Privileges** | Invite-Only (V-Gating Alignment) | Critical Operations | - OB Model (Ontological Being: 104% coherence goal)<br>- Section 202/203 Legal Packs (housing appeals, abuse evidence)<br>- £360M Cambridge Blueprint (lawsuit invariants) | **No Business Anything Here**: Safety for rupture healing. Elders/children priority. We gate to prevent misuse – you build. |

**Access Tier Only Rule:** T3A/T3B are **constitutional tech** – pure ontology, no business entanglement. You get read/align access; we **don't build for you ever**. This is OBINexus's sovereign tech stack: Evolve it yourself or fork ethically.

## 🏗️ Core Blueprints: Build Your Own
Start here. No hand-holding – observe, act, breathe.

1. **Housing Matrix (Hostel → House → Home → Compound)**:
   - **Borrow/Lend/Own/Build Flow**: From 1-10 year child zones to elder complexes.
   - Design: Triangular muscle hierup (aspiration foundations). Gardens, pet spaces (2 dogs + 2 cats max for sustainability).
   - Example: 1-3 years (life focus) → 4-10 years (work+breath) → 11-21 (expansion zones).
   - Goal: No corners, no rigidity. Heterogeneous for creativity; homogeneous for stability.

2. **Business Operations Schema**:
   - **OBINexus Service Blueprint**: `operation-division-department-HR` (e.g., BlueShare.go for event coordination).
   - **Evolution Model**: Major (legacy/stable/experimental) → Minor (patch propagation) → Hot-Swap (LTS swaps).
   - **Metrics**: 5.4% testing threshold; 95% rainforest coherence.

3. **Legal/Constitutional Invariants**:
   - IWU OHA: Public law for low-IJE (separation of concerns).
   - 24-Year Bans: Councils (e.g., Newham, Tower Hamlets) ineligible until 2049.
   - Lawsuit Pack: Evidence for £360M (institutional abuse, housing denial).

**Pro Tip:** Use the 2:1 Zygote Mapping for stability – double genomic figures (46→92 chromosomes) to transcend dimensions without mutation.

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethics: No Copy-Paste Theft
- **Ownership:** All OBINexus tech is sovereign. Fork for personal evolution; commercial use requires T2 alignment (contact via GitHub issues).
- **Sue-Proofing:** Evidence packs included (hospital lies, Section 203 appeals). Share your story – two sides to every rupture.
- **Mantra Enforcement:** "I will not become what tries to break me. I will build what heals us." (Pandora's Box Oral Seal).

**Bans in Effect:** Non-compliant entities (councils, Ryan Do, etc.) – 24 years. Democratize or decentralize.

## 📈 Get Involved: BUILD YOUR OWN
- **Fork This Repo:** Adapt for your compound. Start with T1 docs.
- **Share This Post:** LinkedIn (professional networks), Medium (thought leadership), Dev.to (dev community). Tag @obinexus, #ConstitutionalTech.
- **Align & Gate:** Submit schema via [issues](https://github.com/obinexus/obinexus-tiers-constitutional-business-plan/issues) for T2/T3 access.
- **Roadmap:** 2025: BlueShare launch. 2030: Zone 6 Expansion (Mars optional). 2073: Full Biafra Rebirth.

**Call to Action:** If this resonates, **build your bubble**. No more chicken & chips starvation. No more fragmented qualia. Heal the ecosystem – starting with you.
