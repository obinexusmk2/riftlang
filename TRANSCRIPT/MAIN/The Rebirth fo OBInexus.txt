
Turbo camera on off. Okay. So basically OB Nexus uh OB heart nexus connection
0:10
build your own constitutional zone. Obsess uh oha means public IWU means law
0:18
public law the founder of obexess the world's first
0:23
constitutional uh design and security and health care sector model for sector model for
0:31
antifragmentation uh for life first work constitution
0:38
when systems fails build your own now onto the Next slide today.
0:46
Okay. Content going to talk about uh the constitutional crisis in the UK that is
0:52
thorough council bureaucracy uh uh my section 203 appeal uh of three million3
0:59
million pounds for constitutional healing. Number two heart or soul constitution
1:04
OBI means heart or soul. You can call me Mr. Obi by the way. Uh constitutional
1:10
framework. A constitution is where you live and work. Live and work. 2.5 miles
1:15
to where you go to live and 5 miles you're going to work on some dangerous projects.
1:21
Okay. Uh 03 going to um I'm going to talk about uh threat business
1:28
architecture. We're a business. We're not a charity. We're a business. You live there. You work there. Four
1:34
human uh centric technical systems. Basically technical system just mean
1:39
like the technique not a method. It's a binding not a driver. It's just a technical specification can evolve. Uh
1:47
doesn't it's not fragmented like a like a like a method. Every human sensor a technical we don't know everything.
1:54
github.com/obex's biodirectional learning framework. If you prove you know everything in a
1:59
domain will solve this problem but everything is a technique
2:04
uh in a in a domain. uh 05 economics and economics and bio implementation model
2:10
and uh this is just the economics you got bioeconomics and bioeconomics. So basically everything equals best of
2:16
biological sustainability. The humans the humans first economics is like you
2:21
know economics like money how money moves. Now guys remember economics is just applied mathematics. economically
2:27
just supply method that just means like um if I if I have a house cost£10 and I work for 20 I should have that£10 20 cuz
2:37
I bought a house I only paid for house£10 you know if I work 20 keeps 20 pound as a profit you know if I want to
2:43
keep it I save it you know then next week I work for 2020 20 again and next week for 20 but the house every day I
2:49
paid10 the house stays 10 pound that's the goal you process six model you know
2:54
six model process the diver into individuals, you know, you know, that's what we call biological economics,
3:01
bioconomics, like you know, the building of the sustainability of infrastructure. Uh, from dystopia to consider healing
3:08
dystopia, my dystopia is an album actually. Uh, go to medium.com/obex.
3:13
Find the my dystopia tracks. There are three albums to watch out for. One with
3:18
I'm going to live my book. I'm going to make some music. Then we got the conition crisis one
3:26
constitutional OB next life first will constitution zone. Oh basically this is
3:31
my uh manifesto when customers lose several million build your own governance.
3:38
Basically that's my manif basically when X happens wrong when when X fails build
3:44
your own Y. founder from dystopia dystopia broken
3:49
world a fragmented system hospital uh 1516 17 uh no support social
3:56
care molested harass abuse I'm going to say that to you because I'm a writer I'm going to write all about my experiences
4:02
when systems fails build your own my book is called um what's my book name
4:08
blood sweat and tears a generation left behind jenz genz era
4:15
2000 technology 2001 2000 Wikipedia come out
4:21
uh the fragmentation problem here current constitutional systems force a
4:26
destructive separation between life and work creating a con that weighs brillless mind on logistics instead of
4:33
innovation in short if you don't know coition just solving problems human serial problems
4:39
you know the gating place is really based on coition anyway it's just g computational competition That's what
4:46
gating really is. If you gate something, you're working with real life systems, you know, human.
4:53
That's what gating really is. Put it the computer can build it. Can solve your game problem like a to-do app. But
5:00
gating just means open a gate, close a gate. What's it to do? It actually to ask more questions, more more questions,
5:06
more human- centered questions, not just like computer questions, you know, around the people. Space X paradise
5:12
engineers building uh the paradox building Mars rockets while they're trapped in housing crisis committing two
5:18
hours daily. Why are you doing that? Elon Elong Elon I'm going to call you an
5:24
ex for this video if you want. Ed on basically why you getting to go two more hours to every day to to do build
5:31
rockets that stupid house rockets council failure seven miss oh don't give
5:38
me a house these people are stupid plus 47 documented violation leaving citizen unpredicted stop tax by your money dak
5:47
you know that's why I don't pay you tax you know if you're watching this video I don't pay you nothing you know you can own a house if you want neurody first
5:54
I'm autistic I have adg you have spures you know left with without cultural protection. Basically my position meant
6:01
to protect people. That's the goal of the position. The more people you protect, the more you profit, you know, cuz when people are thinking less about
6:06
the work and more about the how they interact with the business, the masters, you know, cuz I'm my master just three
6:12
years cuz you know the masters for witnessing you work, you breathe, you work, you breathe, you know, the
6:17
breathing spaces two years, no masters and two years PG. Cuz you know, you're
6:24
going to live, you're going to be working, but you're going to be breathing too. You know, you're not going to be just and PG is two years. So you get four years instead of one year
6:30
master one year PG you can't just keep working all the time with human beings
6:35
there go neurody diver why did you abandon me I'm 24 25 okay uh system fail neural system
6:45
respon will respond with consciousness preserving architecture rock
6:51
what am I still doing in this stupid place you call uh broom what am I doing here anyway uh that honor different uh
6:58
neurological patterns patterns you know if you github.com/oblex
7:04
brain computing interface BCI/b you can find that pattern there guys
7:09
that pattern is revolution you're going to find system but that's not for they banned from it all my business models
7:16
okay gradual witnessing protocol from a 0 to7 full protection you get full
7:22
protection no one can molest a child bring them to the position to
7:29
citizenship so you can become to work at a citizenship you know every ensure trauma free development stop
7:35
traumatizing me stop traum you social care people I don't I didn't stand for some of this [ __ ] anyway that's got
7:42
direct instruction tracking so you got diagram which stands for direction instruction that's a technique we can
7:47
call it directed information can call it director something can change the word I don't really care what diagram is is
7:53
director short he knows what he does he tracks it he knows He knows we can try try to get directed
8:00
symbiotic random access memory but you know my mouth is on new kind of system track uh development to present
8:07
systematic induced trauma that's your oral cell
8:13
system I hope you guys can see my pen right uh one second let me just try to oh sorry um so basically I'm going to
8:18
try to my face system in trauma stop traumatizing me I mean like I'm not your
8:24
friend. I prestitution. Oh, sorry. Uh, I got to
8:29
clear this now. Uh, no. I'm just I think next one. Okay. Uh, next heart soul
8:37
constitutional framework. OBI. Heart or soul. Basically, you got the soul of your feet. S O L E. But that's a rubber
8:43
soul. You know, it's not a real soul because the soul is the foundation, the foundation of the constitution. You
8:50
know, people think they're so transidential, but album is going to stand trans and
8:55
the cycle trans because we got my dystopia album one and the cycle repeats the repression. You go uh and the cycle
9:01
continues. Uh they go my utopia which is just the final album which is constitutional singing, dancing, money,
9:08
everything. But you know what I'm saying to you? You got the soul of your feet. Uh which is like the rubber soul. But
9:15
you must be connected to the soul of your feet. You know the soul not the soul spelled this one s o
9:21
oul cuz you know darkness is connected from the charge of earth. Our ecosystem. The soul is the ecosystem that we are
9:27
around you know. So the new is so going to preserve the heart and that's what
9:32
we're going to preserve you aura seal basically aura means like what is your
9:37
aura I my aura's obi my heart but my seal is the foundation
9:44
the constitutional framework you're going to live there going my going to live there you're going to work there my utopia and I'm transcend the cycle of
9:51
oppression and depression basically you go to soul b like a butterflies on the battlefield which is a garments going
9:58
If you go to github.com/rt ob nexus rt y going to find the butterflies on the
10:05
bathroom representing the beer friends be means come fr means take be frank
10:11
come take taker and that was a country that's a country before Nigeria go slave colonism you know the triangle model
10:17
1976 colonial war the UK colonized uh go to
10:22
the b of took slaves put it to Brazil South America and they big plantation
10:28
fields for them and they work there and they and the blood, sweat and tears of a black man, you know, and they put them
10:34
in Europe saying, "Oh yeah, we are rich." But you got understand colonism is not really about
10:40
um black or white. It's about not about race, anything.
10:45
What's colon about? You know, I don't want anybody to call it people. I'm going to explain it very closely to you. It's about power dynamics, power, power
10:52
struggles, you know, cuz you know, there was new framework. You know, everyone had their own governance model. You know, this is how we work. This how we
10:59
work. This how we live. But this place was the colonial power. So this what the constitution is meant to protect the
11:04
most vulnerable people in society. That's why this constitution. That's why it's a country. You know, you know the
11:10
constitution is literally a place for the most vulnerable to be safe.
11:19
No hit me, no hurt me, no touch me. [ __ ] off. I mean fudge, not [ __ ] off. Anyway,
11:25
so basically go colonism, they take your power, take your land, everything and say it's your fault and you forget it
11:30
over years of time. You say nah, not know my fault, you know, you know, because we don't know and they twist everything. That's what colon is about.
11:37
The power dynamics, that's what it is. The direct by like, you know, social dynamics, social friends, interaction,
11:43
it's about governance, who has power in the future. Now, Africa is not a third world country by the way. It's a first
11:48
world country because it has all the resources. It just has a very poor infrastructure the foundation which is
11:53
my PhD if you know you know I'm going to come watch with BFRA I'm going to cuz my oral seal is like my oral because you
12:00
know my oral seal you know the or you know the or is like um feels wrong but it's not really that because you got the
12:06
symbol of the man or get it now maybe I can get it now
12:11
no I don't think basically got the seal but I can't find it now I can do another video then but you know the seal is like
12:18
Um, it should be here somewhere. I basically I shouldn't find it. I should be
12:24
struggling to find. Um, so one second guys. Uh, let me try and
12:31
find this oil silk. So I'm looking for an image. Um, I drew. I can't really
12:37
find. Oh, it should be on a better sign. Uh, one second guys. I can't pause this video. I don't want to forget about it.
12:49
I should have it here. Get it. Anyway, maybe another time.
12:57
I'll show cuz I'm in the mood to show you the orus basically, but I can't find it.
13:04
Anyway, so that's the heart of soul cuz the soul is the feet and you go butterflies on the battle. If you go to butterflies, you go to cuz the
13:09
butterflies were the be the battlefield was the colonial fighters. They're fighting for their future for their
13:15
butterflies. You know, I'm going to have my be in uh Newham, Cambridge,
13:21
uh Newham, Cambridge, Kent, Redbridge, uh Ream and Dagnham cuz I've been all of
13:28
them. From New I mean Dagum from Reagan to where
13:33
Barkin Barkin from Barkin I moved to um just on the social care uh health and
13:40
social care. Uh from Bucken I moved to Thor. From Torque I moved to Kent institution. From Kent I moved back to
13:46
where to from no for Kent to move back to
13:52
Thor. From Tor I moved back to where uh to from Torque I moved back to
14:01
um I came I was homeless about you in January. Never forget this. You were homeless too much. You didn't care. You
14:06
know now they're going to be homeless. You're going to regret it. uh three three months going to be homeless and
14:12
then they're gonna and then I don't care whe they died. Okay. And then 3 months uh I gone from there to
14:19
now I'm inford ID50 key 15 is more stupid place I didn't get a house anyway
14:24
I'm 24 years old I'm going to see my house in front of my house out and I'm going to build a nice house for myself I don't no mansion nothing just nice house
14:32
basically got the life here live here the life of the basement you know two two people house not even one person no
14:38
more you know people are isolated going to have at least two people minimum you can get a dog a conditional
14:44
You know, you even like dogs and colors cuz they are they are friends that you can talk to. So people want pets, you
14:50
know, one pet. You're going to have an aura. You're going to take care. You're going to learn to work with nature. You don't be scared of nature. You must be
14:56
scared of nature. It's your foundation. It's your aura. Going to work and you're going to love that cuz you know you're
15:02
going to be you know take care of okay. So you know one more thing the virant closes. Inviron clothes are very
15:08
important because you gain new foundation. Everything in ver is mitigated you know like food, water, shelter, human rights free of charge for
15:16
you guys. Actually, I don't want to give you free of charge, you know, but you can allow two of you can eat two meals a day like me, you know, if you want three
15:21
meals a day is not funny. Two big meals, breakfast and dinner. That's what you're going to need to eat. You know, don't you know, you can spy however you want,
15:27
but you just keep your time breakfast and dinner. You know, you don't eat three meals, nothing and and gouge down
15:33
food and tell me that you're you're fat, you have to leave anything. But the rest to provide people's human right, the food, water, and the shelter, the two
15:39
houses, that's conution. So the ver important every new foundation the sort of we're going to get into the more so
15:46
we're going to try to move the varant stuff the housing stuff into the invarant frameworks into varant closes
15:51
extensions to the policies the varant policies and varance speification everything is invarant as you know
15:57
that's the foundation that keeps the soul alive the heart alive you guys the people that in the constitution the soul
16:04
is um not the rubber soul so of your feet but the soul is the foundation that that that helps you navigate the bound
16:09
it can be oh yes I have I'm Happy I'm not feeling angry. I'm not feeling depressed.
16:15
OB Nexus heart spoke connection. Nexus means connections. Heart connections. OBI represents heart or soul. When Nexus
16:23
means connections, we bridge design soul centered with technology hard under constitutional compliance. You know when
16:30
system when system fails build your own infrastructure. Build your own. Build
16:35
your own. Uh plus or county synergy law serving
16:41
community upholding law. This birectional diagnos
16:57
you know when you live there when you're living when you're in the zone there's something called runners high when you're running and you're running high
17:02
people don't know this but I know this the runner is high is because you are in this mood you're in a zone you're right
17:09
you can't make a mistake cuz you're you know your ecosystem you can run for miles the work is high because you know
17:14
you have nothing to think about That's probably you can can win if you go in most car you can win a flawless victory
17:19
like six times you know because you know the the system you know what you're observing you know how to navigate that
17:25
IU law provide legal infrastructure bring topology governance and anti-fragility through distributed
17:32
authorities distributed decentralized networking burst on node peer-to-peer models boss
17:39
ring topology counties councils bon ring you know this ring is going to have like a names anyway You know, cuz anybody
17:46
name no one's going to name a street stupid name ever in their life. You know, I'm going to have like people basically any anywhere there's a home,
17:52
you know, 2.5 miles, you're going to know that's a a way to work 5 miles buffer zone that you can work on safety
17:59
critical systems, you know, to work in there. And if you have like a problem with them, you you shook it outside,
18:04
don't you anything, you know, no that. So you get like um so you got like the
18:10
all the road signs all the houses going to make it look like a house you know a house is not a home a house is not a
18:16
home a home is not a house you can stay in a house can't be you can't call it your home if it's a house it's just a
18:22
house all the houses are boxes today anyway but my goal is to raise a standard two plus one public private
18:29
housing if you want private house get private sector house like ontology basian infrastructure AI house and uh
18:36
and then you get for my PhD and because you b ontological meaning how the AI knows it row the tasks to do it stuff
18:43
whether it's a bianium meaning probability probability inference like a bian inference like you know what's the
18:49
range of probability or just the probability that something will happen like you know I prefer the ranges because you can go from
18:55
to activate the AI talks to do the talks
19:00
correctly and then you go intelligence AI intelligence how small the AI is you know and then you know that's Basically
19:07
going to have like two AI units in your house at all times at least two because
19:12
you know that's how if one breaks you're going to do the same job but if one breaks you got the other to repair the
19:18
other one cuz it's full torrent you know cuz you know you're going to be two separate location it's going to be together when pour water who's going to
19:23
spirit and going to be sealed everything you know it's your house you guys system you speak to your system come in hey OB
19:33
heart or soul can you tell them my life can you tell my co So, but going live at the bottom and going to work basically
19:39
going to live work at the bottom cuz that's where going to come in. People can come into your shop, your house, you
19:44
business you want to set up business structure. They're going to live upstairs if you want, you know, and you're going to be have a drone delivery
19:49
system based on GitHub that comes with OBX DTS delivery tracing system. You
19:54
know, they're not going to deliver your products. You know, they're not going to come to your door for delivery nothing. They don't deliver nothing, you know,
20:00
and people are going to use the the the the service adequately like, you know, I'm going to come there and deliver the
20:06
no even want to develop. They're not even meant to come to your compound just put it in front of the the space there
20:11
is the breeding space there is. If they want to wait for you there, they can't even come to your house and knock on it any time and don't waste your time. You
20:19
know, if they want to go to the back door to deliver, they can do that, too. you know, not just front door noses, you
20:25
know, because I don't want anybody going ABC around my house as if they killing me, gonna kill me, make me hallucinate.
20:32
Anyway, so you got the front door and the back door. No one should come to the back door. Lock that back door very well, guys. You know, and say I'm use
20:37
the front door if you want to front space you want to do it. Don't waste my time. Um, ring zone. So, this is like
20:45
the ring zone. It's going to be really bad, but like a ring basically go ring one uh ring zero of our council. So the
20:52
council is there. The council is there. You got like you know ring ring zero run
20:57
council council is the center of it. Ring one. Okay that's the council county council like you know the way you can
21:03
solve your problems to protect the most people. Anybody with ring one anybody who ring one goes to ring zero
21:10
for their problems. Ring two goes to ring one. Ring five. But everyone to go
21:15
because you know if they have educated work problems they go up up up up up you know to the constitution. But you know
21:20
the people that are murderable are ring one you know you know that you went to work life you work you live there you
21:25
have a life problem you go to ring zero you work you live there well you're ring
21:31
one sol ring one you breathe you want to breathe well stay ring one your problem
21:37
solved you know cuz you good to go to ring uh zero uh for find anything else apart from anything else and then you go
21:44
to ring two ring two you know you can go around ring two PhD researchers Remember
21:50
two years PhD cuz you know you got to breathe got to work be really living got
21:55
be observing everything and nice life and then you go to room three masters in
22:00
two zones you know uh room four community center h room five private
22:06
housing but room four and five are linked but you know because you can go to um and then you go like uh get houses
22:12
everywhere you go in this buffer and then zinc safety buffer so you go like ring four and five which are the same
22:17
thing but you know They're not really if you got private housing, you're going to pay for that. You come to the community segments, you can go to the PhD
22:23
research, but you're going to be working all of the time. You can work anywhere you want. You know, in the ring, it
22:28
doesn't say, you can work anywhere. You can live anywhere. You can work in there, you know, this conution. And then you go six safety buffer. So, basically
22:35
five is uh check point checkpoint uh two second checkpoint six is uh checkpoint
22:41
one. So you go to ring six you get uh the housing everything and the housing
22:47
uh you get a checkpoint which can put expansion zone uh ring five response you
22:52
can expand the service outside you know it's about making ring seven ring eight etc for new service unit I want to just
22:58
make sure because I don't really care about council terminosis but that's the goal of the constitution to protect the
23:03
most vulnerable you know I'm going to say that again you know this is very close now most terminals
23:10
uh next the tier three tier business uh etc. uh open sense open sense open source
23:17
basically got tier one tier one it's basically the two three tiers tier one
23:22
provides uh the foundation public code and frameworks for communities to build their own constitutional artist when
23:28
traditional governance fails github.com/obex if you go to my YouTube shop find a more
23:34
link you can find on social media my documentation everything I'm worried about my YouTube
23:39
channel by the way because the the URL and code is like the URL encoding is like uh phone and if I if I try to
23:45
switch it, I may do it wrong and if I do it wrong, I'll lose my access to my YouTube channel. That's what I'm worried about cuz once you change my support to
23:52
open.org I'm not even uploading recently recently cuz you know something's wrong with my
23:57
malformed YouTube channel URL uh to sign in on YouTube channel cuz you know framework ring zone topology the ring
24:04
the basically got the ring zones bring zone one the ring is like the ring zone is like the buffer so you go like a life
24:11
work breath and you can go bring the life bring the work breath zone life
24:17
zone work divergence first design for committ Transparent against the life first infrastructure model transparent
24:24
free of charge service the operation the organ this is
24:30
just a schema service um uh service first uh you just
24:36
get to the service basically this like uh dual cycl graph um page ranking system you know like it gives you the
24:43
service but you know it's based on a schema model that's nex search and polyot because it gets you the right
24:49
schema because this is a schema but this game is based dimensions you know it's basically gating but it's g so has a
24:54
dimension to it xyz dimension for like uh um contract services y dimensions for
25:01
uh integration u models you can search this up then get it I'm going to build my website it's going to design it's
25:07
going to come and going to level your work there is infrastruure as a service pay as you go diagram consist
25:16
like a direct ram so basically you can search for this on so search open IASS you can find the services under
25:23
infrastructure as a service and then you get uh pay as you go uh diagram can pay
25:28
for the RAM the RAM if you want to get diagram support ticket you know community health
25:35
support tickets you know go to these links you know just type in search it up index snap you get that from the website
25:41
you know you can even explore the whole constitutional framework on the website if you want it uh plus leadership R&D
25:50
Tier three provides access to to advanced research. Wait,
25:56
basically go tier one. Okay. Basically, if you go Oh, no.
26:02
Basically, go tier one. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go back. Go back. Go back.
26:10
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't, I can't stop now. I have to keep going.
26:15
So, basically, tier one, tier two is um business access. So um but you know but
26:20
they're not really uh so you got open source and then you got tier one open source. So basically got a schema it's
26:28
like mapping. So you got um write down. So you got T1 or tier one which is
26:33
called github.com/open open obxopen-t1
26:39
open- t1. This is just tier one model open source everything open source and
26:45
you get a T1 um T1 um T1
26:50
um open access and sense T1
26:57
um business access and sense and T1
27:06
and E. So you got to t1 T2 basically can basically T1, T1, T2 and T3
27:17
open access B access but you know it's going to map as mapping you know can be
27:23
from T1 to T2 to T3 based on your OBS access credit score you know the credit
27:29
you get from working you know living and working at OB access you know based on your aura sale cryptography
27:37
uh system uh let me just see if I can find later but I have to finish trying to find it later. Okay guys, human
27:43
centric development you know. Okay, next one. Diram dire instruction random ass memory
27:51
tracks individual cious state to ensure constitutional protection uh to prevent
27:57
system induced trauma. Stop traumatizing my constitutional friends uh direct
28:02
won't give you house 95.4 four chromes via aura seal verific
28:07
basically now aura seal is a algorithm the aura of a person it's a sealed aura
28:14
and that's the foundation of that person for me it'such and essay
28:19
knowledge o I'm ob 95.4 Four witnessing know everything they say via OC I'm not
28:26
real I'm not I mean real but you know via supporting neurody diver path through residential witnessing protocols
28:34
from a zero to agent you know you know that's coherence operators are invented
28:40
uh human loop and human out the loop bar framework seamless between human loop and human out the loop for optimal
28:47
governance you know you know seamless filter Basically this is like a OBI AI
28:53
framework my model of position uh filter sorting searching filtering you know to
29:00
filter like a puzzle thing you know you know like you know let me stop let me so basically if you have this room and
29:06
there's a puzzle all over and I have to solve the puzzle the filter is like um uh like you got a quick filter is just
29:13
basically human condition the quick filter uh go quick filter like a quick
29:18
search I can pick a corner piece I can I mean the corner piece but just going to start placing it everywhere and start
29:24
finding way to sort it you know carefully you know that's OBI filter to
29:29
flash a flash storing like you know quick you know you know based on epist
29:36
function if you go to github.com obsess epist function you know how the AI knows
29:42
it job like you know the flash the storage so you go like quick flash
29:49
quick flash and Quick filter and go working filter and working flash and
29:55
these are birectional. So basically the filtering of a of a person of an
30:00
algorithm of someone sorting the me swinging the puzzle. I pick I try to find a corner piece I find a corner piece I put it here. It's it's about a
30:06
star a machine like like a building or something like a like a map of the planet system the black hole the center
30:12
of the Milky Way and it's a puzzle about that and they're very small pieces. I filter I search and then find a way to
30:19
organize it. Then I flash. Ah, now I understand how to sort more. So this is my first flash. Rapid flash. Just a
30:25
quick flash. Now I have enigma. Now I salt more. Now I can do this over and over again until I get it 100% right. I
30:31
know every piece by memory. That's that's consciousness, you know. But consciousness is condition. But
30:36
consciousness just strips away complexity, you know, then I go here and there, you know. So if cuz you can reuse
30:42
no energy I swear you will because that's my solution to uh evasion
30:48
intelligence architecture you know how the AI knows itself learning avatar 70
30:53
to 30 review and execute you know you guys any chron avatar tell me your
30:59
avatar who are you I'm Mr. Obie you can call um uh other people by their
31:04
nicknames you know but you know these are constitutional names your identity your sale what you may call who how do
31:10
you want people to see you when you work what do you want to show to the world that's an avatar based on my personal
31:15
development framework in contract to John John persona framework bridges 5050
31:23
balance you know you know contract sealed I'm nami I'm Mr. Obi heart and
31:29
knowledge. Uh I mean king leadership and knowledge or king. I mean king in Nigeria as well.
31:34
I'm a princess in Ni but you know that's one and I have to go back to before I turn 25. Uh but I really don't care cuz
31:39
I I'll solve that problem later. But I want to show my house because if I turn 25 in I won't get I can I have to become
31:45
a king in in my dad is a king. Uh housing pro progress without homelessness. You will never be homeless
31:51
in constitution basically. Okay. Okay. Basically 2.5 m walking ridges and 5 miles maximum
31:59
for safety bar outside the constitution you know but you know you have to work there cuz it's like direct but you got
32:05
to work there to test something that's going to cure people and if you die it's your problem it's not your problem protects you sorry it's like your
32:12
problem if you make a big mistake but I'm saying no because sorry I'll protect you guys I love you guys I love each and every one of you that's going to work my
32:19
in the future I love each and every one of you so basically one to three initial years 1 2 3 years 49 years 10 years
32:27
membership. So basically if you get one year you can go to two years and two years you get to four years and that's
32:32
the maximum and then you know that's the one year plan uh and that's like one year four year track uh 1 2 4 and then
32:40
you go to progression so you can start at 5 years 10 years and 20 years uh and that's the
32:48
10 to 20 years mark. So 369 10 to 20. Okay so basically this how it works. So
32:54
basically you're going to have a child there just going to allow children that you know cuz you going to be very smart anyway going to be better than anyone
33:01
they didn't really know if they don't know you're going to go anyway and you're going to learn from you're going to learn from me and I'll be teaching
33:07
your kids you know everything so one year one plus two year to five year five
33:14
year uh 125 uh 124 sorry and then the four five
33:21
years because you know that's the PhD so you got like if you want to stay here uh four years you're doing a masters. So you got like uh your SATs paper you do
33:28
your GCC you do uh one two but it's just three years but
33:34
doesn't mean anything three years is what bachelor four years is masters
33:39
get masters get a consition build your own stuff anyway five years for your PhD
33:46
so that's again s paper uh GCSE paper and then uh GC ST GCS and
33:57
ST GCSC and um
34:02
uh diploma diploma get a diploma which is like called a DPL
34:08
I don't know what that's called but you know I know BSc is a bachelor so diploma you just talk about it the DA you don't
34:14
have to if you if you're playing if you're doing diploma in sports you just talk about the sport you don't have to kick a ball or make a sports yourself
34:21
now the bachelor you make you you apply it you You you play a sport, you use you play football, you play rugby, you make
34:27
your own sport, you apply your knowledge, you kick a ball, you you play basketball, doesn't matter. You find new
34:33
techniques. Now, masters two years in OBS, but you know, I don't really want to basically
34:40
could be one to three years, but don't worry about this. I think I have to change this. So, basically one, two,
34:45
four. So, basically, you guys should be giving power. So B doing B do do a bachelor uh
34:53
uh in I should be making you do a masters cuz you know that's two years already your bachelor to masters right
34:58
so one year I'm just trying to work it out one year is what uh one two four so
35:03
bachelor is uh so basically you got like a a bachelor already that's two years uh
35:10
diploma bachelor now four years three to four years is master you get master you
35:15
guys can get b masters one to three years you want don't tell me Okay. And then you get uh 5 to uh 369
35:24
and then you get to 10 to 10 to 20 uh for people who are you know you get
35:30
to do business every day. You can have you can have beautiful run there and love people and live your good life. You know you guys don't deserve to be in a
35:36
room like me. So 10 to 20. So if you stayed for 10 years you contract for 20
35:42
years and you didn't do it over again. You know you guys are good people. No. So no determin
35:47
for for writing stupid and then uh economic and implementation model
35:53
the five universal condition dividers all economic uh activities within
35:58
contribute to 2.5 uh univers universal funra and reversing the traditional work life
36:04
par. So basically uh to the to the uh universal contition
36:10
divider. So we're going to have a project routine basically a diagram for it. So basically got the diagram here
36:16
from life to work from to life to membership to foundation to prosperity going to respect you you know you know
36:23
div so basically you're going to be div so basically going to be um um divided I
36:29
don't know what I mean by this from healthareation education access housing guarantee you
36:36
guys need to be happy you guys should not be stressed never in your life you know the future is now build your own time is now the time is now build your
36:42
own and reverse life basically you you're going to have the system uh 25%
36:48
universal fund you know you know cuz you know you don't you start with something you don't get nothing
36:55
okay so you got 30 p basically con so you got like a basically my understanding of this you get like one
37:00
acre of land one square acre that's like one acre of land with something miles you know and that's one square that's
37:07
one person's house but you want two people you get two people's house there's no one button
37:12
house unless you're really depressed and you want one person out. I don't really want to give you that. You go can get something else. But for now, but you
37:18
know, two people's house, you know, why would you deny that? You know, I want to give people like, you know, get a two pet like, you know, two pets even want a
37:24
house to yourself. But I don't trust people who just houses you know cuz you know 30 acres initial zone 15 homes max
37:31
you know you know you know and then that be 100 acres expansion zone you know it's going to be total life work breathe
37:37
you know you know you know 30 acres for 30 60 life to work to breathing you can
37:42
go to the shop go to nightclub I don't really care
37:48
demonstration Cambridge thration basically sex is meant to work for life you know what uh housing you know design
37:56
sector phase one 20 25 to 266 phase two
38:02
2016 you know and phase three you know global expansion you know you know you know this is three-phase implementation
38:08
very important guys so b20 uh but this year uh I'm going to go to Cambridge 26
38:15
I restarted my finish my masters my PhD
38:20
next from dystopia to healing oh my This basically this my song my album from conscious degration
38:27
to conscious healing the album the try on make the song and the cycle repeats I
38:33
got the album on medium post you can check medium and you go album too and a psycho contition you know intentional
38:38
patterns I know you guys and a cycle trans I transcended this is just excess
38:43
you guys give me songs for you guys I'm a dangerous man put some money in my pocket okay open sensory framework so
38:51
basically just like a touch feel um like you know for example I'm going to diver I experiences really based on K and
38:58
Katis inverse kinematics and Kat basically my I just myself I feel myself
39:03
yes but that's my senses react to me my sight I see stuff I hear stuff that's a
39:09
five senses but the IQ says there are seven senses because you know my perception
39:15
is a six sense and that's like things coming to my zone they're getting XYZ uh
39:21
and then you got like that sense uh Z uh Z gate is like things I perceive external from me uh while the
39:28
integration of the units how they work at the component level and that's the six sense you know this five senses
39:36
touch nose smell and then seven sense is how I perceive the outside world you know with that senses you know that's
39:42
what that's what this open sensory framework open sense github that comes
39:47
open s open access open reach open reach is very powerful Guys, you know an open
39:54
sense is a beautiful but you go like a neurody divergence first open sense framework
40:00
uh that's framework open access framework for uh non neurody divergent people which is
40:07
not neurotypical people um market opportunity will you target a
40:13
market offering failed university town these people you failed basically tech
40:18
companion abandoned by rigged You know I'm I'm a JZ. I want Jay-Z people. Don't want
40:24
people that own nothing. Computer world design and computer sector ring
40:30
topology. No single point of failure. It's a ring. It's basically the ring model really based on the system of um
40:35
computer. I can show already but you know the thing about ring topology you got like the hardware then you got the
40:41
software the firmware but there's a bridge cuz the ring around the the software is not open to the system. So
40:48
it's a hardware fault. It's not like a is a root but more powerful distributed for everything you know and I don't want
40:53
this stupid uh security ring topology but that's how the the b like access patterns you know people trying to uh uh
41:00
touch uh create their own nano config file I mean pseudo config uh to touch uh
41:06
based on unique systems you know that's why the we have that kind of system to uh get people's uh the p password files
41:14
pass um p pass wd
41:20
call to action. Build your own zone. That's the zone. I want you guys to have
41:25
all of that guys. I don't want no no religion. No one's meant to be religious. Please, please, no religion.
41:31
You know, I want you guys to to because you know the problem this is very close actually. You know, I don't want to in there because you know I'm not religious
41:38
because when someone has religion, you're going to say I'm not working because it doesn't meet my faith. And
41:44
the problem I'm saying is because people don't don't have religion. Just keep praying and they don't do nothing, you
41:50
know. So what I'm saying, it's kind of hard to me to comprehend religion because there's no proof to it. And you
41:55
know, it doesn't really mean a pro we going to live happily and work together,
42:00
you know. I don't want you guys to be religion in there and pray and everything. You're going to be working there. You know, it reminds me of Mecca.
42:06
If anybody had problem, search up Mecca. Mecca and you can tell me whether Islam
42:11
the the Islam community there which constitution in his own right are are
42:17
still harassing people but they're not they're beautiful Muslims yes because they have their own soul and everything but you know I want everyone inclusive I
42:24
don't want discrimination that's why I want no religion you know you know you're going to pray can leave the position and pray outside the position
42:30
you know you know I don't want you guys um to be there for now you know because with the religion with the faith uh
42:36
because you know you're going to walk can kill Anyway, um let me mix up so I can move
42:42
people from there to out so I can move people into the uh the own way to work. But I don't want I want to know what you
42:48
guys know about relation cuz I don't think it will work cuz Mecca is a mess anyway. Um zones the future is
42:56
constitutional zones will transform to antifragility communities where humans live completely integrate spaces walk to
43:02
rocket basically space engineer walk to rockets their building. Just walk. Just walk to your rockets, man. Hey, I'm
43:08

No, no, no. Guys, thank you guys. Uh I can't find my full seal,
44:42
but I should uh Okay, let me make a review on it. Okay. when I find it. Okay, thank you for watching.
44:49
Uh, and have a lovely day. Open access is ready. Okay, so open
44:54
access is ready. GitHub comes with open uh uh open-tier
45:01
one. github.com/obi nexus t-
45:06
open-t1. Uh then you get github.com you know to
45:12
business access github.com/ open access oct
45:19
degree in computer science uh so I can put in front of thor
45:27
where my where my bachelor anyway uh the website is called obnx.org And you guys, you know, should know
45:33
that, you know, any lawsuit go to HMR tribun HMR courts and tribunals online
45:39
to sue these people. Uh, and they can basically you're going to go they're going to delay you. They're going to defer you. I'm going to defend their
45:46
business or they're going to def delay you, deny you, and defend your business. Defend defer your business because you
45:51
know if you if they defend their business, they're going to delay you. Hey, hey, hey, what's your time? It's your fault. We didn't do a deny you. Oh,
45:58
we don't we don't know anything about it. uh and defend or go somewhere else. We're going to defend our business.
46:04
We're going to pay for house. You got to pay for house or go somewhere else. Uh delay, deny, defer. Delay, deny, defend.
46:10
Now, if they defer you to go somewhere else, defend it's your fault and you can go to court. If they defer you and or
46:17
defend their business, don't listen to it. You know, if you fall for one of that's a trap. Let's go to trap cuz you should try ent trament.
46:24
And this why in positive policies are there. They're varants that the variance they're very close to everything you
46:30
know no one should be driving the bus slow if it's a bus service or train service or train service you know
46:35
because want more money and want people's time you know those things that that that just invarian policies invance
46:41
specification in variance articles like healthcare article 2014 uh fre doesn't
46:47
because you know articles you know anybody that tried it anybody that tries
46:53
will hear from me directly because that that screen diagnosis too much in my Okay.
46:59
I'll click the question straight up. Okay. Have a lovely day and good night
47:04
my OBS at twitter.com uh for business inquiries uh business already. I don't
47:10
sue me. Anybody should not sue me. Uh just open source for now. Uh oh, an open
47:16
open peer review is ready. Uh can send me a message open uh uh issue and uh
