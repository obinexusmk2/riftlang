And that's what you guys have for Rift. Is this to log in my work? Yes. Yes. No, No, No. Yes. Yes. OK, Basically stop now. It's it's stopped. OK, Let me just stop this recording here.So pyramids have started. Are you recording is started? Yes, yes. So I just think about my mom. I'm a mum. Is that with me? I think about the beautiful thoughts of my mom, thinking of my mom, you know, But I'm trying to improve. This is the most cool system, but I've never done Morse code, sparse Morse code in my life. Uh, but I do remember how to, uh, phonetically do Morse code cause, uh, the Morse code is just what we use, uh, for the system. Uh, because it's not, I don't really have a, uh, for the polar system. So I can, I don't know Moscow, but you know, I'm a defensive so I can define this past matrix They can model anyway. A true position, true, but there's some kind of sports and coding function coding which I come to now. So this pass metric research goes from the left side negative to negative. Negative to positive, positive to negative and then we get that's just a they get a negative, negative. This is for negative systems. This is we call negative in our world. I can. So what's the video? So for if I want to transfer myself just all my life, after trying to find out who's namdi, I think all my stuff, not my mom's stuff, and I try to measure my own stuff. Oh, this is numbly. But this time 'cause it's blue, so I get that. How can this matter? Something be blue KIK so observe name is life forever. No, if it takes five years to consider with a mirror and I see in front of me, I think a mirror. I look at Nandi to the mirror to the computer system. Oh, that's my university dimension. So I thought to maximize my mention my mentioned 2 to half ratio. Communication channel, it's like a mucosystems because I want to be having my cameras literally observe everything, observe everything and not in the same time, you know, 'cause everything that's in their relating and nothing and not acted in them in my universe because I'm just listening to universe. There's no that I can relay everything they sent me back, you know, 'cause I heard it dot GSR interpretation files, dot GSR files and the GSM and the manuscript files. We can be shared polygons, Monica systems, you know, the money system for manual develops in the loop human on the loop, you know. Uh uh, life process, uh, try to upgrade the systems, but you know, it's kind of, umm, basically called human in the loop. This one's out working on it. Human are the loop, which AI systems and human on the loop. Uh, just use the one interpretation files are really bound to the human uh, uh, uh, out on the loop, But you know those ones can. Sparse interpretation of the finishes Python error exceptions a a, a model, or or JavaScript. Sparse structures that resolve definitions like what's the function of define a function with deaf syntax. This is trying to move all of this to matching roof to matching structure or something so everything goes in line is just a matter. Matcha you know, but just listen absurd in a jewel string to the RRR like you know. So if you have like an R on coding because R encoding like a sparse encoding epsilon so sparse you try to use this properly. So I'm gonna give you an example right now 'cause I think I'm talking too much right now, so let me stop jumping and try to do it quickly. So you got like a So 'cause it's phone coding, you have 16 states minimum, so 4 * 416 states. The I can observe my universe. If not a good name, she's a -4 + 4 is 8/6 so. It's a it's a state of mind and I couldn't observe 8 states of his, you know, to us to connect to 16. So it is 16 = 16 states. Which one? If I just want to see Namdi in his own reality, I have to get 16. Physicians, uh, uh, maximum, maximum. I wish the new minimum, uh, for everyone if I was to see the sound everything. So if I, if I, if I speak to them again in 16 states, endemic, 32 minimum, there are two maximum 30. So I guess this is the same. Speak to him, I can hear architecture etcetera. 15 + 16 is 32, so 32 shared historic. So now that means he doubled half. So now you have to measure my relative on basis 16 + 1616 + 6 eight. 910 Eleven, 12/13/14. 14/8 plus one is 9. UH-14. 8-9. 8888910111213 So it's 910 Eleven 12/13/14. Of 14 or plus one is 24. So 24 minimum states to to to speak to namdi to get some stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Get some to get some things around. So here's something understandably you speak English by the way, I'm able and meet someone that I love and related. Stop being depressed. I'm not depressed. I'm just like both. So this like define basically you don't, you never talk a constant, you never reduce a dimension into anything, but even try to amplify the relation. So if I say I'm doing like probably so you go above and beyond, you know, if you have, if it's just like one test, unit test. So it's a it's a if I'm if 25 is the minimum, 24 is the minimum. You can 24 years old. But if I want to show that I'm only myself for doing it, I do the math month 20, I do 25 to 4 to plus three more to the. The three ratios are 2425262727. I write in seven tests just to make sure that I come, I go to this room, I can, I can, I can observe them, they can hear numbly, and we can have a decent conversation without losing connection. To between a a system. Thus 16 + 16, That's 32, not 3232 Y. So 32 Watt 32 wide because 32 is the what we agree on the the actual the actual one regular. So the one on communication of testing octopus or what we're gonna relay how this works. A a consensus based on you can have like a a like 16 + 16 + 16. But there are two just OK for me. Give me a little myself. I really don't care sometimes. So but I do care definitely I do want to try this one in the real world for sure. So. 16 + 16 + 16 is 32 so 322432. So basically I get 24 to 32 minimum but you know 332 is the minimum. I can double 32 towards 64 so 64. For the host full bubble to work we have to have 64 consensus minimum. Minimum 'cause you know double this is let me see minimum of chess artifacts. They can resolve the the the duality of three dimensions. Oh, oh, sorry. Oh, this is 4 dimensions. Uh, uh, this is, umm, this is, this is for the encoding, This is for commodity encoding as 4 * 4 encoding. Uh, so there'll be like 4 kind of data organizations. And what would it be in number? W2 epsilon states that are conjugates. So for every epsilon state is a positive epsilon. There's like a nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nothing, nothing. It means nothing. You are 00 nil, nil and you get the next one you get. 010 epsilon and then you get epsilon 0 and you get 000 epsilon. But I just knew one new type 1. So this is nil or zero empty, empty. We don't measure anything, we just listening. Listening for stitching and then we can get zero and then we get 0160 is bad is bad directional. It's try directional. So we get this money is nothing, nothing, nothing here. And then we can search for 90 channel and then we can go to. Not a huge channel you know. And you can go to 0 E then 0 E gets A continue from 00 and get 01 or 0 E 0 ZE and then we get zero. I mean E 0. And then we get 00. So basically this is just zeros, pause 0 sparse nothing 'cause you know if I ever drop a constant zero I will lose information. Never, never preserve that zero 'cause we knew, we knew, we saw nothing some kind of interpretation. That's why you have the the GSR. So the judge this is just standard interface, but the management files are just basically the the GS files, but the the iota the GS files are are like a different one. So the. If files are intervention for the polar Go system, Python, RC Go and then we've got all of that. And files, the manuscript files and then go to file still. Same thing for the coding. So you get AA0I mean get 11 E so you get a one basically 'cause it's usually the stuff in the box, you get E1. It goes like a binary. So basically my E1 is his. 1E he's he's 1E but he's he's -1 E, I'm positive. So that's the model. So for my positive E1, no state, no transitional memory E1, I get a 01 E, 1 E and then we get a AA1 E and then we get a A1. Sorry so. Is the same as 1 E 1 E My E 1 is a epsilon 1 so epsilon one I get the conjugate of the conjugate of 1 E and then one EI get the conversion of E1 E 1 and then for my 10. 'Cause it's not because like a kind of like a well, according to a coincidence, according to the rift artist will do the same thing very fast in a system. So you get 1 E and then you get 10SO10 will be 01, the inverts 1. For my positive side, a negative positive word and there and his +1. This one will be his one will be. His one will be opposite so my one his his one is what 01 His one is my one is opposite. The flip bit of 01 is 11 so this is the last one is 1 E is because 01 and you get 1011 positive 11 then that means that. I get one What? Sorry, I get one 'cause it's not like all the bits, so his one will be the -1 so he if I have. -1 E. Negative politics have -1 ethos you have. Positive to negative because it's a position world 1 E for one he will be 1 E will be so easily for E1E11 E. 1011 they'll be negative politics, negative, positive, negative and his one will be the same thing but one EE 1:01 and 1:00 one and that's fine. Quality table don't, but of course quickly according to computer or computer also computation in parallel, because can do all at once, because there's no need to store something you observe, you can just discard it doesn't need to lens it, it just discards it automatically. Just it just gets to the point. But this is kind of a humming cold that that sees less and doesn't store the space where the conditions get the coherent by noise. So this is claiming as an action 'cause you know if the system is Korean enough or using one computer or you do your test properly, it shouldn't go back and then you should wrong should happen ever translating dimensions. Anything else, Mandy, you want to tell them? The next video we'll try to look at this IKEA principle, OK? Basically the IK principal, so 28 S So you have a a test if I do a 14 unit test? So basically if I do like a module, I have 7 out of five, seven code and seven functions. A sparse function I get 14 to 46 minimum C code. 9/9 plus one over the time. Nine 9 + 2 four is 30 now. 30134563 minimum test I can do for myself for us to align. Test and code everything but you know, just like a beacon mean I mean the CS file mean dot C file a main function not Polygon. That way for a minute first for redundancy to make sure we can understand what what the concept here I mean the C file. So I get union operator continuously 3 three data data. Those are structures or unions in arms. They can signal using biological informatics to NAMDI actually can't believe NAMDI relay, he can relay just observing him. So to signal to minimum and then he gets his three, I guess he's a three so he's won't. Negative test a negative test of 63 his reality see where I can observe his observe his reality a birth of children he can get married. So this one is fine for like a mini seats out that's the same the code she's basically 16 data models. Uh these models, uh uh, these two models that sports uh 63 watts, 63 functions functions uh that are tried that consensus see what I can uh let me it's actually active right now. I can see it under my screen. It can't work guys right now. On my find out, you know, do you see if he's if he's if I find a name, they're saying yes, yes, yes, I can say Oh yes, basically I don't skip this guy. I say yes, Nandi, this is right. I this I'm I'm not communicating with you now I'm busy. Let's say this now lens. So if he says yes, yes, you can use the computer yes and he says if he says no. That's consensus. You said no, that's don't have consensus. That means no consensus banned. So if you said no, I'm not asking, then it stops. But if it keeps going to online, yes, we should correct. Yes, I want you to connect. Yes, I want to connect. Then we connect and say we'll talk and I see him face to face. Via my messages What time is now? Oh, oh, basically, yes. So that's plus, uh, uh, one. So basically it's basically like, uh, I guess it's a 3 test can do, but 'cause I'm thinking about dimensionality, uh dimensionality, the kind of test can do a test of dimensions, uh, you know, test of dimensions and, uh, test of dimensions actually, uh, after insurance, I am part of that bubble. This is my bubble here, the computer program. Yeah, but so I can observe his word on his computer, international, international internal in the bubble universe 'cause I use the bubble construct of his dimension. But because I can't pop this bubble right now, if I write a program, because this, my computer will not explode unless my computer explodes. And that's the bubble ended popped, but it's not my consciousness. I'm not really. In person, that's why I don't need a bit of harm in there, but it's not cool is closed. I can buy a new computer, you know. So that's the dimension. It says it's very important you get that right. So dimension principle here is part of the machine test. So since the three test models, so to make sure I'm doing this properly. 3 * 3 is what you know, so 6363 + 33 + 63 will give me XYZ that will give me the amount of let's say 3 * 3 * 3. 189 so 3 * 3 is 189189 minimum minimum test after right to get it right that should have my computer didn't explode. I wanna wanna find one in modules or see libraries or like some kind of artifacts that resolve into the sparse framework. So sparse models, sparse functions. Muffin with two to 1/2 to 1 and half two, half to half to two, obviously, basically half, half to two. And then as something that's coherence, if I pop, I can, I can resolve the issue, I can fix my computer, I can read my computer basically. Without breaking my universe, my universal brain, bending my room down. But that's one to two and then two to one ratio 'cause. You know, teach one to just pop safely. Come back to my relative and now I have a headache. Like, you know, now he's dying saying, 'cause I'm kind of an artificial or something. I don't know, something happened and the noise. So only one pure signal. Never noise, never noise, never noise to in relay with Nandi or the other universe. So 2 to one. I want I want to have to one mapping there we go. The system is so this one. So you have to make the CPAP contains functions. It should just work work test the way. So basically you have 189 what? Test I can test this at IK if it's kinematics principle. So this is the especially if I get 100 tonight files the ministry program the program roof should work the program with the R or R: so much what? Observe whatever's Nandi like a dupless tree. Basically, you have to understand that I'm just activated program. So to see what NAMI is doing right now, I can just observe lens infinitely with this one program, mainly EXE program running in my computer to here as well right now. If I brought this program now, now the RR basically the office in fact. So if I want to. It's been some Moscow, so I can say I can try to encode whatever I want to do into the mosque. Also, I don't know how Moscow works. Let me see what I can find how most good works. Let me see what I can. Oh, can I uh, let me touch your oxygen Monday for it because I, I don't know how to read most could I listen to add my ear system how to read Morse code? Uh, G give me a second guys. Let me try to find my ear system how to read Morse code. A A a a ChatGPT. How to read Morse code? So we have to find out. So basically how to move on? No most is mapping so dot so a dot is short, a - is long. So basically. A message, a space between a symbol is a short pause. A space like a blank comes with a short pause, a space between letters. It's a it's a medium pose and a space between a word is a long pose. So this is like a dot dot afford - is letters. Word so dot or - or is letter to words so. So so think the dot is the dot. So yes, learn the alphabet. So a start EF left dot is right so E I'm Speaking of F basically I'm E. So if I was to say my name is Namji, I do the matching. So I have like a start note or if I start, I start. I just want to use this. I start corruption my lens and I observe numbly States and I type in I try to lens wherever the system is and then I say my name. My first wish will be like hello namdi. Are you there? Oh Le, hello Rifter. Hello worldly, Hello Rifter. Are you there? This is actually implementation right now 'cause I wanna give you guys to do it. I start EE, start EE. So starting see you soon. Rhythmically you should read them and rhymes don't do rhymes much rhythm just. Uh, it's the post. So if you think about the, uh, rhythm, uh, the rhythm is the, it's not rhyming. Uh, the rhythm is just the, the, the beats, uh, the beat repeats the rhythm. Uh, it's the rhythm of the night. Oh, wow. But the, the rhyme is like at the match. The match in a bit. So there's this is the you can inverter, you can 111 is just as much. That's why I want to use this. So if I want to send Nandi a message, I have to construct it on the other end in the inverse way, use it in the reverse way, the polar reverse. Reverse the inverse variant, the invariant and invariant reverse of the polar construct. Because we're in a bubble universe. So how that will work? My name is Namdi. Let me just try to ask GPT my name. In Morse code. Morse code please, because I don't waste any time. NN AM DI. I uh, uh, uh, Michael. Well, with. Message to all Rifters To all rifters Let's unite. Let's unite, unite. So basically you can have a a stream, a duplicate stream. You so long to do it, you knowing me. So basically no fluff namdi. Oh, so my name is Dash? My name ends a Dash. My 2 ends a - my. M - dash D is dash. And I is a dot dot namly, so actually like a - and a pause and two. That's unopposed. A-AN opposed A dot. And obviously I do a dot first, then of course it's isomorphic to it. The system, the conjugate system. Nandi Michael Appala to all of those unites so I can get his message. I can use like a a a self balancing red black animation tree to mind you the model, the conjugate of what I'm saying so I can have some kind of a sparse encoding that translator, the translator converted to the invariant system.
Yes, that's fine. Instead of getting numbly now, let me start. This is on Uh, then this must be on to. Should be double shoe stream. In Rihanna, today's date is 27. OK, so I've got recording right now. I'm going to my voice. It should work as intended. Yep. So let's do this now. OK, so before you start one more thing, please forget this. You mess up the whole thing. OK, before I continue, I'll write something down. I need to bring it down properly. Because if I don't do down properly, I would like to mess it up. So let's call it the this one here. It is a perfect circle. Perfect circle. The pie number is 2.14. This is a absolute pie. Absolute pie. It's a constant, but then it's a constant. But you know, maybe it doesn't some kind of other, a substrate that's a pie constitute. Oh, sorry, 3.14. 1415 etcetera. Then we got that, so the circumference is 2π R, 2π R, 2π R is what parameter and then we get and then we got the area of π as well. So normally the problem of the bubble theory, there's relative bubble and absolute bubble for a bubble universe. OK, guess I've done that. OK, So guys, this is very important today it's about. You got the the bubble. Basically the GS files, the GS on main, MMM for mother, A for alpha, I for Indigo, N for November. Does GS files are are the main files useful to write AT3A and T3B? Program, but you have dot G or the GSR Gotti DSR got the lab interpreters house is a polyglot. You know his translation interpreters house. These are main, the GS is a main. The GS is a user file. So basically I user files are just different files. But you know in production, so if you're in production, you're not doing T3A, you are doing sign up. You know there's a task for the. So basically if you're doing a testing or anything, you do it with the the GS I files, then you do it with the GS files, then use it to do to do. Your DSM files so the money from publicity the old managed for each other. So the manuscript files are the GSM is different from the GSI because only on the tier models tier 1:00 to 2:00 to 3:00 to 3:00 to 4:00. 23822 because I don't want to be ******* this up, but the triad model or the sparse dried. OK, So, uh, that's uh, Gussie Lang the, uh, versus uh, so this is got the public theory that we live in a bubble universe. Uh, a universe is a reference to the bubble. It's no squares anything unless you are, uh, OK. Basically this is the model here you see this positive, you go negative, positive here you get plus this chart, negative chart. So you can if you go if it if you if you go up plus one you have to have. So basically, yeah, half. Basically if you have a unit a + 1. One units for way you have to to go back. You are at a minus. You are in a universe like a negative university works you know just a half. But you have to have the unit to go to the opposite universe. So you you do a + 1. Plus one and the half down half of plus one is half. So you get half, but you're not a 0, not a zero. So you now know where nowhere and everywhere. So that's the thing. So you could you're nowhere and everywhere in the Bob universe. So what you going to do to get to universities go to half of 1/4 in 1/4. Now 1/4 has to scale up 1/4 * 4. Do times 4 * 4 for one, 4 * 1 of 1 to 4 is for and then if you do 1 * 4 it's four and then you do four of our. Usually 4 * 1 is 1 and that is not 4 for one. Now if you do opposite. So you then floor 1 and then you have to do the opposite one that's 4, flip it invariant 1 is full force is 1, and that will give you the one unit -1 it's just to do. One, uh, but that's, uh, just one conjugate. So you have to do the opposite operation. Uh, uh, so you have umm, plus UH-4 goes your nose. Plus, you know, one that should go opposite so perfect into the universe, so you go plus one. Uh, uh, just do uh, so basically you try to work it out myself. So you get a a shut up, so you get a a minus. Also I'm obviously I'm a one here in this I'm +1 'cause I'm minus plus is positive I want to go to the -1 so I do. Half of them I do half a shrink, half that's I get 1 units, 1/2 of units that's like 1/2 of 1/2 is 1/2 and then at the times by -1. One in the other direction so you can flip the second negative a half. One negative half is not enough so I have to do times -2. Consecutive 2 is what, a +1? So now I'm in. I'm not -1 sorry. I did that to get the universes. You pop, you coming, you pop this matter where you are. It's probably basically it's our universe. We're bubble theory here. This is a universe expanding 'cause we're bubbles. We never bump each other. I don't really know, but I had a we can pop to other universities can go there. 2 * 3 is 9/9. 32693 plus 3 is 6 now. So basically the basically you have a nine dimensions maximum you can search with universe. I'm not being theoretical, I'm being practical. If you look at it's just I don't like you know, so this 9 is a concert differently like a. So if you have like the pie 2-3 point hTML5 essential you can get, I can get the position some sort of arbitrary. Some kind of precise competition. Guys don't. This should never be arbitrary. You should never make this up because you know if you make up, you can lose signal. The signal are you being noise, you become the power noise. 3.1415 etcetera. If it is bad, let's just give a couple of prior to the nearest decimal. 3 point, so three. So the pie is a pie is 3.14. 59 to two different places, but. Two at the end no, if I use this console, this is a conscious term 1592. Now that part is the is the constant that spans spans the whole universe. It's just as constant, but you know it's infinitely constant. It's irrational. So you can never you can make you rational. You can. You know, depending on this kind of way, we're gonna go listen to some competition on this because I haven't done this here properly. So for example, I am the part in our world is a 3.14. So 'cause we are positive we are positron world so we go from negative. So we get if you want to translate to this we go we have to have minus first and then plus so we can get plus. So you can get plus one point 3.141. 922 you know 2 basically the three per month 453.14. 5 is just 123451592. 63 So I'm gonna just keep the 1st 123456. Six, I'm gonna **** you. The 1st is there's more places keep it and then the 65 is a wall operate on later 'cause you know, it's just like 333. So OK, 123456789 So what? 23456789 So basically I'll Kee the 1st 9 decimal places. Then keep it as what I'm observing and acting up on so I get the 9th person. That's IK principles investigative testing. Show my system can work for you. This feels guys can blame me but I don't have money for you. It was kinematics, kinematics testing. So if I want to go to another universe, say the opposite universe, that is a minus plus first and then minus 'cause it moves in that direction using the DAG, the union DAG, I have to first do it properly. So I'm at my π number is 3.14, so. 3.14 uh, one. The area, the area is completely complete the area I want to go to. So minimum I have to go to the 9 area, 9 dimensions. I send 9 dimensions to get something stable, 9 dimensions minimum and then +5 and so many maximum. To for myself to just go there only myself, but I'm thinking of you guys just to think 15 days more places 3.14. 15926753. 58912345678. 12793212345678910111213. 15 So you go 15 there's some more places and that three 2 is what? 3H. For recovery now 'cause I can do physical development like the dimension in that's what the that's all the dimensions I can access with my bubble where I am. So after use of the kind of teleporter to go to high dimension. So this is I this IK testing for me. So basically what I can do in that dimension if anything happens to me. One ascendant. So for me this is 3.4. This is bubble. So how can I go up? How can I go up? Let me put this down guys. So how can I go so I get the the constant to 15 decimal places as the unit as a standard fractions? It's a fractional unit, but it's fractional 'cause you know and you can go to the fractional unit and then you got the scalar units, the scalar just one number and 1 hole or hole, not 1/2 or something. And then you get to work more, uh, the, uh, the whole picture, the one hole. And then you get the tent units like, umm, the tent units like, you know, uh, actually like a big guy. Basically, it's gonna move. Basically, if you conversation, you can have like a 5910. So the 10 units are looking what is the tent or something. I can exist in that universe, but I can exist in the smaller scale of things and that means that something is wrong with my system. So in the worst case the 10/1 so. So how to this properly so dimensional Max now so. A 2π R. Π R 2π R 2 * π for the perimeter of stretch. So my universe that'd be times 2. To 612-331-8530 just. But guys, you know, don't worry. Just make sure you can read it. 179-586-4769. 23456789101112301415 decimal places done. That's 2π in my universal -2π will be. Same thing -2π because it's just a. A reference of 2π The same thing but negative. So radius. So my radius. What's the maximum information you can read if you can read only if I probably read? This is what, 10 units? 1 units? One unit? Can one unit bubble? How far I wanna go in that universe? So it's like an XY coded system, XYZ coding system just for parameters perimeters. So if -2π is. Most two-part is what same thing but negative π -, 2 or -2. Now Napa Π R so basically now show 50 kilometers to earth as the earth which is located. OK, so let me try to get this properly. Let me try to give it properly. Let me try to get a pharmacist on longitude, on Earth latitude. And longitude. A postal code? I'm going to do it properly guys. A postal code? Google Maps. This should be working still. No it's it's not working. I think I'll just like a it's just it's just working. Google Maps. So what can I find? Find ID 50EQ. Uh, uh, but what's my, uh, postal code? What's my latitude and what's my latitude? Latitude. And longitude. I basically can have all the information there is really important. Latitude, Latitude. Longitude. Uh, the postal code 0 Basically, yes. My latitude in this world is what? UH-51? 587573 and my latitude is what? The magnitude of my longitude is 0.0. ** basically, I've not selected rotate myself into the dimension. So what I do now is I literally try to do do that, do the computation again. So basically as I'm talking to you in this video right now, I want you guys to acknowledge this in real time. I lost my video then I don't have so much time. So my latitude is what? My latitude is what 0? My latitude is 51. Basically it really gets the same additional place 1515 so I don't lose any information, get any errors, bound through false positive errors. Epsilon states for the encoding contribution to transcend. I love this. I love this guys. I could just be evil and not keep this to myself. I'm I'm feel grumpy, but I'm Mr. Obi. Why feel grumpy no more? I got money. Thank you. So this will get people out 'cause I'm trying to it goes to 3 minutes my they will not let me record anymore. So again. I'm going to stop the video here just in case so I can do some things. So my parameter is this 51, so my luggage is 5158 seven. In the IG50EQ right now. Amount of 518754. 5187574 that's my latitude and my longitude that's like the up the Y corners is what coming from my longitude is. 00.0 8444 But you know, the most busy, the most gonna work on this side kind of unit XYZ coordination to ensure that the alignment is there and we're gonna embody the system and never break it which embodiment on my spiritual environment going back to. UH-4 umm, basically, uh, latitude. So that's just X&Y if I'm a 2D. So 'cause I'm 'cause I'm a 3D beam, I get two more dimensions. So if I ever scale it down to just two dimensions, I'll be a 2DB. So I have to have like a so it's a 2D matrix. So that's the first unit, the first one. So I have to get the healing and the ethylene and the so North East. So to go north, to go to North Pole, I have to get one 918-9662. And to go north, oh, sorry, N lane and then east lane Northeastern. Basically go like a NE you can go like a N you can basically doesn't matter your frame of reference. OK, let me just try and compute this now before I **** it up. My calculator's there. I'm I'm watching, I'm streaming right now, so I don't really care. I think I say I can save a number because I'm streaming for myself. I I'm not sure if other people really. A calculator. What's a mind I'm doing so so so so so basically, So basically I'm giving she gets a transcend, but not in the in the kind of like a quirky way. So basically. 02/02 times π. 2 * π is what a 2.14 and that is. Do times for the X coordinate. Basically for the perimeter, two-part is a three inch. So basically the two-part is just a minus plus or plus -6.2. 31853017. 123456789. 10:11, 12/13/14. 15 so it ends in A7. OK, just copy some more 'cause I don't wanna make a mistake 695-2876. Make a mistake in calculation that means I I would die. I'm thinking about myself. No, you guys now OK, so 5 and 5592 that's 32 small places and now to go position. So that's a teapot there we get the rotation then we get. 25R So my Regis is what uh, the reason I want to go to is my license latitude. Uh, so basically the Regis resort uh, uh, the egg of the bubble I want to cover. So basically I need to produce myself upwards and come downwards. So the reason I want to cover is just this room, but the area is not sort of the ridges. So oh, so the Ridge can be a unit model a unit. The radius I'm in, it's just a latitude and the latitude. So which can be the latitude and the latitude. So you can multiply think of the lasers. What's this pass? So that's the polar system. So the the basically this get the latitude, longitude. So that's another only so I can reflect myself 'cause you know that only that dimensions, the dimensions to 2 dimensions. Let me try to get it now again. Umm so I'm trying to save this properly now, do you? I don't. OK so now I get 5. Oh no no, my R is what my life is. What? So I do. I took this number. The latitude and computer over the referential point, so that's eastern, northern. If I'm going east, I'm going NE is that way. So that is upwards to NE lane is towards basically latitude are going to north, longitudes going to. Uh, uh, right, uh, but as long as it's, it's lane, so, but you know, it's easily, but you know, the east is on other side hemisphere going to Russia 'cause I'm in UK. So let me just copy this number. And type it in times times times 1 so times what so my. Sounds so good. In one dimension I am going east. If I'm using a long longitude, I'm going up up in latitude. That's my up. So my up now. I have to project upwards. I have to transcend based on my universal claim is of this that I know it works. Is after B. Basically I have to go all the way to positive. Positive 324-1234. 2869. 898. 3 so that's the first positive. So basically it's in a positive location from a latitude I have to go and this positive, this positive, positive I get a positive number, so I'm going to be positive as well. The other one, the longitude, because you know, the longitude is just oh, my longitude is a unit, OK, so 318. 79 and 50 killer, right? OK, 969-6469. 28286969. 83696969. 396-4866. +1 So I have to go to so basically after polarize myself for this kind of plane, whatever it is to transcend it means the real world. I don't really know. There's a teleporter there. I don't know, but there's no this can be in the universe. I don't know. So I have to go all this way to 324. 1-342-869-8983. Sick for and that should be places hopefully 'cause it's kind of hard to compute infinitely, but you guys should do, should do it properly, should do perfectly, guys, once or for all find for you. But you know, I'm saying that there's a positive dimension in. So I have to project myself there, uh, if I want to transcend the go to the full dimension, uh, uh, so go to So this is basically go to 4 dimension, protect myself this way. So sorry, go to the opposite universe, opposite universe. Woman from so negative, negative, negative, positive so we get like this positive, positive so now other ones like you. So we do the same thing 2π three Pi. 2π times times. The longitude. 2 pine. So 2 pine. So 2π because π is half a cent and then times longitude. The location is now 0.0. 68444. Basically this isn't gonna calculate the position. Most like get some chemical or position in Morse code. To do this, project my pin up to 30 minutes 'cause you know if it starts with elements will stop. No, two or three minutes. OK, so that's my frame of reference, but you know, I now get the actual iPod. So now I have to go to 3 point 0.21. 50231675. 22998 which basically doesn't issue. So if I'm going for my form of reference I can go to the opposite universe in my bubble. And then see my guy Namdi in this room I'm in to see him in the universe based on the I don't go to this. I don't have to go to upper dimension. I don't Basically, I don't have to go upper dimension to ever come down. I used to flip the system 'cause you have to think about it, flip how you know. See nothing. So it was a golf with the mission after either use more energy after user the half rope, the half double row, which I'll show you now. Guys, I'm just making sure that you can get this down 'cause you know my book is gonna stop. So it's a close. Really. It's really a close here. So that's one down. So that's my done. So basically for mine from my preference, numbly is other numbly. Is that 33324? 0324134286989 And then you know, but you know on a -1 he's negative system. So everything is a this world is a everything is charged by positrons. So the positrons charge everything because you know it's a negation word. So the battery is working in a positive charge is moving like a positrons, which is the opposite of negatron in this world of Nandi is in this room. He's a calm beat with him directly, but you know, if I, if he's a made of matter, matter, but he's got a bit of antimatter now he's working his computer, but now he's thinking about me and now he's thinking about how I can make my life better, not even be struggling. But that's the first thing I'm gonna say. Tsunami is still dead, but he's conscious. But he's a, his conscious will be inverted if it's if it is him. So 'cause you know the bubble here. Possessed me to go there. So stabilize the bubble in and out. So you got 1/2 row row, the half to two row which I come to, but I'll give it a swim 'cause I'm in London universe. I am like a, you know, I have to protect myself from matter, from the anti matter. I have to give myself 2:00 to 1:00. Close. So basically my coach is half every time the you reach the dimension go half like 40 to 3D go 42 dimensions, you get a dimension less you don't get get all the dimensions information. So you have it, but you're not 1/2 roll half half half scale, half half scale. Half scale, uh, half transcend, uh, just half to two. Uh, so I, I stopped basically, I have my, uh, half my resource, I have my time. I become a lesson. So if I'm a circle right now, if I'm a square, I, if I'm a, if I'm a, if I'm like a, it's my hand. So my hand for me to go up after a double over my, my lensing of my hands is to go up. So a quadruple to. For the 2 dimensions, so uh half times 1/2 is 11 uh one. So one has to get like 4 ones to go to UH-4 dimension. So that's 4 ones basically. Basically you have to go up to come down. So you go up. Sorry. So if I, if I skip this, if I maximize organization of this reality to my 3D Mart, I get 3 * 3 as 9? The 9 dimensions of access. I think I get a a a 3 + 3 six after six universities. Keep the IK 9, I kept the 9. Uh, that's the. Constant trying to reach if that concept doesn't actually devises to 8, that means that something wrong with my frame of reference and I just kind of something is going to happen. I can die in the alternatives, whatever I've been there get into my destination. So that's IK to K principle. 926 principle. So we found a go to 6 dimensions. I can do 2 * 3 is 9 to 4 dimensions I go. I have to observe of my frame of 6 dimensions to four that will be 4 dimensions or seven normally and then acting on observing minimum but you have to maximize. That's a nine dimension. I can if I want you to do myself a computer, but the two dimensions are there where I can lens are 15 cause the 15 dimensions in my reality that I can't interact with directly. I'm gonna see upright and then OK, thank you guys. I'm gonna come up to the other one. On the other one, what's the code? How this works in the four dimensional world? OK, thank you. OK. OK, Namby uh, now, uh, sports is uh, muscles broke up too. OK, so. Bubble 3. Transcending. OK, so this is now done. So if you just work guys, there's nothing should be wrong with it. Really they they should go. Nothing should go wrong with it, Mandy. Same thing. Now this is the same thing. Should know international. Stop. Let me stop this researcher now. I exported to, yeah. OK, so that's like a video. Oh no, where's my transcript?
So the mic is now transcribing, I'm now transcribing my voice to use auto AI, keep a backup of everything and then this very, very possibility. I've still started video. OK guys, the video hasn't started so it's not starting now. OK, so. Recording. Oh, it just started. So recording. 52 one thing oh oh oh they just create 2 active scenes so I can start the active scene recording of scene 2 so I don't have to switch to scene 2 which is new feature. Actually I I, I OK let me just try to record scene 2. At the same time. Oh, no, no. Oh, so there's two things recording now that's seen one and scene 2. OK, let me just go back to scene one. But scene 10 and scene 9, OK, I can hear my voice. It's hearing. Everything's going according to plan. So this is recording 2 scenes, 2 scenes, the camera is holding 2 scenes in real time. So this is getting better 'cause you know, trying to before you go started trying to make it more authentic. And that's because you do the same thing. And if you're trying to do it from your own view. So of course, now OK, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK, Basically it's a break. Hold one record 2. It's just active. So let me just stop. OK guys, I'm going to Nigeria for my PhD, but you need to be in Nigeria for my PhD. So you see me in any way an umbrella on the future. Let me see what I've recorded. This I should be recording. Yes, that's recording. So let's start. So my PhD is really on me, myself and I the nature of anthology view of phenomenology as well. So this one just. Started off like my name is Namdi make up Allah. I'm trying to do my PhD but what I am who I am, why am I here in this reality? Basically I believe I'm pretty sure the four dimension downwards and that's how we work. But I already done my ontological intelligence research on my PhD. This is bound to T3A and T3B. Only 60 quicker test. This one I don't know about a dime. Basically I'm gonna try to beat new life. It's into new people. So I'm gonna go to Nigeria, try to give back to the people. Why what they give to me? But AAA, double it, quadrupolis, you know, which is our evil culture away where we are, you know, in Ebola. But I'm the founding act, you know, I'm a founding researcher on anthological. Patient suggests an unconscious systems. If you go to my YouTube playlist Obi Nexus O for Oscar B for bravo I for Indigo N for November E for echo X for X-ray E for. My way to do it. So I have to do it properly in this room. So let me start. I don't set a timer. OK, let me set a timer. I've got one hour to set. Let me just sit for the 5 minutes maximum clock. So 'cause you know, I can use it if I ever do it wrong. OK my timer has started now 3 to 1 started now so go for 5 minutes or to make one video So can you please take out OK see this video then it's now this so guys take a picture of this if you can I'm going to use model now of displaying how we relate to the robot based on myself my position of being the. So see this, this is me. This is a mirror here. So this mirror is like a point in the mirror, a prediction point in the mirror. So this one is a four, three, once a world our time. So we get older as a child, we go older and then we can go have kids. I don't want kids here. So I'm having kids. So I'm a child of infant. An embryo, because of the child, it grows, grows, grow, grows, grows and grows good, up, up, up, you know. But this thing is partial. It's partial, you know, You can't go back. Usually you can't. You can't start from this state to go back. And wine consciousness is a Brewster 'cause you can't. Some kind of a relationship between our dimension and the dimension? Are both of us or below us the 40 dimension which I'm from. Hopefully I'm not crazy. Yes. So the problem is 2 classifieds, subjective reality and objective reality, my social reality. Why do we have oh, why are you conscious objectively? Why would you use what we're doing? You know why we're here when we just processes instructions, You know, why aren't we just like, you know, conscious. What are we? Of the cognition, what we're doing and how we're doing it. What's the purpose of all of that You know that's what ontology is all about our nature, us us us in our being not just one person us entirely no, no, basically the pre control of qualia framework is like. From the goal of this research. So if I go to scene 10 which I am recording scene 10 because I go to repositories. Yep, this one, This is bubble theory ontological. No, this bubble theory ontological is for everyone. Qualia framework for breath life is only about the T3A and T3B. And of course, with knowledge, current power, comes knowledge. We can do knowledge, and that's what we're trying to do properly. We're going. No one dies again, no pops the bubble which I want my people to understand. I'm doing this for PhD. So you charge no charge of a die or starve again. Guys, I'm sick of this happening to people that actually care about. I want to do something. So that's the bubble quality. So the bubble or quality is basically bubble theory, bubble quality, our qualia, our bean for us Ibos only 'cause we're all Ebola, you know, in Nigeria and Biafra Terrace, you know, we're not, you're about, it's not about that. So ontological knowing. Kocher Qualia, Our sense how the relax for us in memory, in time, all of us, all of us ontological and then bubble the membrane, you know the bubble, it's like a plasma system, but we have bubbles. We are stable, we are happy, we are chill, we're not angry at each other. We are bubbles when we haven't seen shell. Two pieces apart, that thing 'cause you know, you can be in a pot without being happy with the sound that, you know, port, you know, without potentially A2 piece in a pot, you can make four piece and that four piece would be sprouting different routes. That's a problem of quality really 'cause you know, we want different interests. We start to get confused. We don't really align with that what we want to do objective and we can grow together. Welcome collapse together. Now I've got the bubble qualia phenomenological now pharmacical. It's like us and them. So we got you both. They are robot or they are robot. We are you both. We know we don't understand them fully because they have different origin ancestry. May we may understand something about all of it. If they don't tell us all of it, you can say. But just just tell us all of it was to just frame it in context. So basically 2 problems. You see, there are four sets of problems, my mind, the phenomenological body, the body, the mind, and so the body, my body, my heart, my physical heart and my my to my. Mine my physical health, who I'm used to love, feel, adore, full type of love cause the agape and I'm not about that anyway. I mean you got a love how to love all of us together love in the nature of being and the nature of being for loving myself. I myself, me, myself and I and loving friends and family. I know, I see, I feel that in my conscience of ontology of pharmacy. Uh, uh, objects right to the state of being conscious. So my 40 conscious knowledge to qualia. So so this is also basically when you look in the mirror here, see that point? That's like a 4D point in space. You got a 40 spatial contract there, but it's a unique looking mirror here now basically. This forty thing, this forty thing is me here. But in this reflection of me in the 4D world, this mirror, this mirror is appointed disappointing the density here that transforms that, no matter how far back I mean, I can also access that mirror. Uh, it's impossible to see this everything in 4 digits and put everything 3D. Everything is umm, everything you can do in 4D or you can do in 3D already, Just you can do it a much more better. So basically every four directly. It's not, it's not all the way around, 'cause you know, you can go if you want to translate the food you have to construct, you have to measure. 4D properties to transition to 40. So if you just make a mistake, you can't align with a 40 cause themselves all the way around. So if I want to go to a four dimensional world, I have to literally know the 4D world ahead of like you know, the 4D world is there, but I can't measure it. I have to observe it, but you know, I have to measure all of. All of the smallest thing about my world and, you know, measures in a way that's coherently stable for me to see it, observe it, feel it. It's like a lensing. Call it lensing because, you know, it's more of a glimpse. You get into the reality. Like I'm talking to you right now OK, let's go on 4D clarification spots now sports now sports definition. Sorry, I'm going to give you this I'm going to go go this video later, but I'm going to give you show you this for now sparse. I should have. I don't. I don't want to. I give it wrong, Give it properly. I don't know. Rush it, Nandi. Sparse definition is very important. You're gonna back it up too. Let me try to do it properly. So you got Oh no no no, sorry. Oh this is mine. Oh sorry, this is my 1 here. Sorry guys. Basically the sparse matrix is what I made to model this kind of change position from the 41 to the two world. I'm going to try to get it out because I'm just calling a lot of people right now, so I'm just trying to get it out here. So right here basically, but I've got it backwards here somewhere. So it's here, and it's here too. Uh, this is very red. This is here now, so just let me see this now and put it here. Umm. Looks right here. It's not here per SE. If you basically said so let's look at it now. Let's be found before I even continue. So let me just try to find it and now turn off the spin. So, OK, let me just pause this. Sorry. It's kind of like skip ahead. Let me just pause this recording. So I find it. If I don't oppose it, I, I don't oppose it, but I don't oppose it. No, I'm just uh, you can, I mean for my sake, let me just pause it uh recording one uh pause. Thank you uh recording one uh pause recording one. Sorry guys just put recording one. I used to pause it guys. OK, Oh, sorry, business recording guys here. So I got through 'cause I'm going E 0. So this is Y00Y1. UH1X1. X1. X1. 0.0 and then one. Y X1. 10100 is Y00. So you got XX0. This is the X1. X1 and Y0 and you go X to 1 and YX0. It's 1, so why 1? So why 1 is this? Why 1 is this so? Why one? And then go Y1Y0Y8. This is a zero or zero that we get Y1. 11010 so it's 01. This is 01, this is 101. Y 101 Y. This is 120101Y10 and 1010 will be a. I wonder if 1E equals E and you get 1 EO 0. You know if you can write to get 010, get here 01. You get 0801011. This is 11121. OK, so guys, let me just record it now, Peter. It's gonna fill it should fill. It filled. OK, so basically that failed now. So let me just stop it anyway, it failed to continue. So I I stopped this right now. Oh, it's oh, sorry, it's continuing. So oh, sorry, didn't stop. OK, I thought you failed me. OK, so basically it's very important to start with this. So these are 4/2 infants are two dimensions minimum to present. Up to the three different, so we saw 2D is to represent 2D cigarettes are four states of 2D component XY. OK, now can you try to do this properly now? So you got a XY only to project up to come to become a policy and Ant to go up a dimension or to observe or have interaction with dimension? Have to go have to construct this table to get it so, so you have to remember so. So it's also for every 001 that starts to go through something called epsilon transition epsilon or two table which one model of A2 table. So I don't really care what we do now. This model is just like a more remember everything which is the bubble. So you get 01 and then that zero is either 0 epsilon E for epsilon 01. So you get from one state and if you go to. As you to the next stage, so you have zero. I have done which could be 1. You get a one and that information has to go to the state machine. So you get the other version. So remember the next state one, let's see one before so one or one becomes one and the output and you then export to store the the minimum information. 01 excluding 10 because zero was the one which is preserved. Nothing was preserved, nothing to spool, nothing in the three world. But I don't want to go through this yet with you guys. Can you try and go through it? So you got A10 so forth and so on for one and 0. So one thing to you guys, this model is called a a. 2 table, I call it a spouse, uh, because, uh, it's a model's order data, uh, and remembers all the states, which is, that was in that data, uh, cause sparsest can, uh, preserve a state and data at the same time, uh, together. Uh, so, uh, if you get to 1 and I want to preserve the one and you want to preserve information first, so you put. First, uh, then a zero. If you want to preserve both A1, you put them two ones. If you put, just put a preserve, uh, of UH-0. First you put a. Only for the 1 you know and 11 becomes 11. Remember all the states this world diagrams based on and this one is very important for you guys to understand that. Now we get the encoding table. So this is an encoding table, same thing as the state but it gives you 2 outputs. You know from coding for classic computation and quantum computation C not gate. So this one's very important too. So you get 0X00, you get to the coding of 0 epsilon, which means no state, no data, no memory, nil. Ontological, nil, nil, anthemological things that are the things that are phenomenal to the work we can see at times. Union, union. So basically it's all operations plus my plus plus and times 0 E epsilon. So basically you can get for if you have two states of 00 between X&Y coordinates. You have to project upwards. You want to go up from. So if you have like a 3D beam like the Juggernaut don't want to go up, they have to protect themselves up a dimension. You can do like a police machine because you can model any kind of projection with matrix without being computing overcomputing. Let me just try that really for now because you know, trying to. Point even I didn't do it intentionally trying to. So let me improve point my point now. So what does this mean to you, For me and everyone else here who actually cares about what I'm doing? Uh, uh, yeah. So so so umm, the including table E epsilon is just nail space of a magic nail. Oh, so fly can fly, man. So. So I'm saying the commercial of nil. Nil means no type, no memory, no value. No means no type, no value. So it means a void pointer. So now a void printer to norm avoid is nothing in the space. So let me try to compute this perfectly with some kind of a prediction of my way so. If I like the standard projection function, you you take axy component and then you transpose it and then you do the calculation on the row and alignment. You know, but you know this is very. Or two or two as you get like a pointer space and time number between 0 and 10, one and 10, so you get Let me speaking about 513 and. 3:00 and 5:00. 4 metrics. That's my position in space-time as an Ant in the world. So just be another one there in the real world in the 3D World. Hope you can see me. So if I'm Ant I see only see my position on XY503. Are there three and five respective? This is my point. In the real world, five and three but. Protect myself, I'll do some kind of rotation so so so so this is the 502 is just my exponent into this SpaceX OY code 2D is five and 3513. Now now, now I want to project myself. So what I do is inverse matrix matrix I do and then multiply by it. So I did the row becomes a column it's called a transpose. SO3 becomes 5. 5:00 and 3:00 so you get a quick. 5 * 3 is no, so you get like on damage to two matches is 1 misses from the version. You should see good transposition of of that version and you multiply it and then you get the identity and then that transpose is five so you do a rule. So basically you take the matrix and then you go row by row, column by column, so you get. 5 * 3 is the row of 15/15/15 what 15 and then 3 * 5 is what 15. So I'm actually a position obviously in seriously if if I see on the center. At the center of something, sense of something. I am basically. I'm basically at 35, my row, my row in the. XYXYXYZ where I am for the learning from reference to a real person that's been projected as a 3D being example. I'm looking at this thing, it's really important. So it's my role rule X root Y. So basically I'm at 1515 in. Have you, uh, already, uh, XY, but you know, I'm saying I'm at a A53, but that's 1515. And that's like what it's kind of conversation 00 to them, this is me to them. 00 is uniform question of five to three. And then just so that's a role. I'm a soldier column, so I don't do the column. So now. If the rule is 5/3. A. A rural column is what, 533? 53UH53UH-35. 5:00 and 3:15 3/5. So this is the column around because the five three is the row and five no. To get the three five 3 * 5 is what, 3 times no. So you get oh so 3 * 3 is 9. No, wait, is it? Sorry, let's try to do it so you get 3-5. This is just the other one. 3/5 No 3/5. For the column or recession you could transport the two matrices and you get to have 535 and then becomes 5 three. Then you get the 3 * 5 is 15 three 3 * 5 is 15 five to 15 so you get 1515. That so this is a identity. So this is the same identity is like my identity between 'cause you know this is just zero to them, zero point to them 'cause it's just identity bound. So basically the zero point will be the the coherent state of the measurement framework. Because the additives metric is just gives you in that phenomenal intelligent phase. Now you have another matrix, let's say 6-3 and seven eight. 78633. The 6th strategy and it's a history, but I keep the same matrix of what 53667 is that and 6-7 and five and then. Of the of myself as a 5 three 'cause I was three. Wait, is it 5-3? I put 359. Oh, oh, this is the uncle's now. This is the uncle's 5/3. This is the uncle's now. 53535, 3, which is the. Element row and then the inverted row alignment is what the inverted row. This you can have up and down and it's. There's no strict up and down South if inverted because 35 when you put in a standard that you don't make a mistake, 35 will be the column. If it's it's an aunt observing that answer, thinking up is down, up down and then the 5335 duality. So it is 2 aunts and three five and and five three go on a 2. Century if they're walking, you know, compared to emergencies, and then they don't know where they're going and they see me, they see me, they see me. And A and aunt, aunt, my aunt, our aunt #5 aunt number, our aunt #5. And there aren't number of. And to be so the same thing just go in opposite directions. Opposite directions now now and a is working at 5/3. 53 but you know we is now becoming up is going to six or seven before 6 or 7 so but you know the the and their hands goes up nuts goes up one like a one unit 2 OK, let's say. 205256727. So they go up to seven, they got one unit especially, so now they're from over 6-7. System 53 so we just keep watching it and five so so we got BBC I was just now store 353535 S we're just watching us we we should we ask 3535. So what was now? So we get the row 6 * 3 is what 16? Eighteen 6 * 3 is 18 now 18 plus something a system 3 is 18 now 6 * 5 no six and three. So the row is what 6 * 3? And the column of the rows 6 * 5 six times 5 is. 20, No 24. 620 four 6 * 5 is 20. Note 2005 is 21 seasons, 4 is 22 * 5 is 24 so 24 and then we do 7 * 3 is 27 and then 7 * 3 is 27 A plus. 7 * 5. 7 * 5. So 7 * 5 would be 35 S Basically I'm observing this system, this aunt, our aunt and our frame of view 'cause our we can download our in our way when we see 18 + 2724 X. Which I couldn't. So basically for my friend of you there it's 910-1112. 128910111212. I didn't get 12 plus 1/3 4:42. Location 42,. 24 homogeneous model 24 + 35 that's 7-8. 9/10/11, 12:12. 12th uh, the 5th, 12th then 12 is UH-23. 3 is a 12 so got the secretary 62 and that's just our aunt, our aunt at position what in our frame of reference, our view it's it's just moved from is recently at position 42. 62 He thinks it's at 5:00 and 3:00. 513 so antics are 53535 question 5 from 5 and 3 means to 6-7 so. This is 70 that's quite good. You know that would be a meme. Now that would be good to me go viral. Thank you for thinking of this example. OK so basically outage is at 6-7. 53 We didn't move from the ads point of view. As point of view, we are just the same place 'cause we are rotated the same place but never moved, we never moved. Ant is 5, three and two out there and we never moved to Ant is 5/3, so 5-3 and then there. Then we go, then we don't move anything so we get a 42. Come on, 62, that's where we are ourselves and we will see ourselves of recently there's there's a great basically obviously goes up to 100 'cause if artists want to 10, the dimension up is 100, you know, 100 dimension. So we get units up, entire units up and that's 1010. We should come back to you later. So with some logic, so our artist there, but you know that's a homogeneous model. Homogeneous. So basically our ants can only go. Basically if our ants have to go to 100, it cannot transcend A dimension. So let's even go to inside dimension and time, it's just a time to be 90%. And up to get one dimension so homogeneous model. So we are at literally at 42 and 57 in our view in the three world 'cause we get like a 10 dimensions to 10. So we get one dimension with the scale of dimension the the the 1D1 point times 10 the 10 telemetry in our world their world their. And then our dimension 100 a hundred, which is units 1 or 10% units, but you know the 40 what I mean, the 40 will be 4D, will be 10 another time will be 100 a hundred dimension, 100 dimensions we can enter we're gonna 100 or 10,000 or so. In the 10/10/10 thousand. 10 * 10 is 100, so basically we can observe basically 100 * + 100 is what? 200 so we can observe the minimum of local, minimum of 200 and maybe just some simple measurement and you know 100 * 100 is what. 00 that's 1 Adobe or 1010 thousand. 10,000. Basically there's a. Basically there's 10,000 from locally become. If in the food you are and you know we can observe which is restriction. This is an IK principle. So that's enough. We can observe, but OK, we can basically be there's a minimum, the minimum system can act on if you can observe it, there's an occupancy, we can observe, we can access minimum, but the capers who can observe it will not be interpreted but as we can see IK there. So this is the key local. How we observe how information is until we get what we just start a new one. I don't want to lose the site, I don't use my system. OK, I just thought you recording 'cause I don't trust my system. OK, OK, OK, so we get the Auntan +1234. Oh that's too serious. They will get 000, two, 10,010 bucks. 210,200 minutes. Oh, we can't measure maximum 'cause that's the union of the whole new system if you do things or properly. So my form of reference is against 42 or 67 in. If I'm 100 dimensions, you know. If I have 100 spaces, you don't. Static system, you know the world is if there's a hundred places can go only, only squares I can go to. This was Swissy. The artist for me is at 4267. So if I go to that and if I go to that and now down to be thinking it's A536367, no, wait 6-7. But I'm, I'm saying, Oh yeah. So I go to six, see that and what? Lives in that square and that 10 units is square, 10 units, 100 units square for my 100 unit square, Great, 100%. So that will be the layer for the heterogeneous model if you agree on a protocol to speak to each other. So I have to get like, so basically for me to, if I want to, for me for 2 / 2, six is 7. 7:00 So I have to go to like if I. My square 00 and social cartesian bound users go to my go to seven six 7 * 6 is 42 and then 62 / 7. Let me go to the calculator. No calculation this hand, only 52 / 7. What about 7? What? Oh, my alarm is done. No, it's not. Oh, 62% is a 8.8571. 4 uh 8.81. 18.857. To three-dimensional places it does 8.58 point..8. 573 decimal places founded. OK, next thing #2 So this is very, very important guys, so let's continue. So that's the importance of this is how it is in our reality. So let me put this down now. I'm gonna lose that. So what is some service? It was different to do the same thing, but you know it's for modeling and coding like a functions. Things down code and run on the fly. But it's past a function of coding a function to come up bidirectionally. So you can have a mapping of a 2 to one functions for every two inputs you get in variability into your reality. The aunt to Margaret. There's a function I can define that unifies them to two to one site. 2:00 to 1:00. Was particular one if it's homogeneous data mapping to one data to a 2. So you can have a 21 function and map it to another function in their reality of time of dimension, that's sparse model that's smoothly sparse. Again, that's a spouse, meaning spouse just means it can be modeled as in in different functions to them. They can have their own function as 2 DI can offer 3D and then once one mapping function using 2 outputs, 2 outputs consider they they. They can then get what I when I when I said to them. What do you know? What do you know about me by dashboard? Two way from two way table from two way cycle of doing some two way to do something. Yes. Umm, so basically I'm trying to do this properly guys uh, OK, SO21 OK, further. So at least he's put down the phone number. OK, so this is the coding table again, the state including uh, this is for for for every scene or gates, you get a queue nugget uh, it's a quantum rift as well uh, so. Next thing we do now this. So I've got my people here. Anything happened? And so let's just try to get a right here. So that's including table again, guys, take a picture of it if you can, and that's fine. So basically, yes. Oh, oh, I just. All I do is nobody. So that's what I'm saying, that it's more about our structure or syntax, but the structure of the information that you're being coherently relaying to the other reality. Oh, this and reactive one. OK, so let me continue with this one. But now I'm picking them nicely here. So this is my work, a nice work here, my PhD because I'm doing APG three years almost so. So basically this thing here is by the way. So let me just give try to stop this video. Oh, the news has not gone by. OK. Oh, it has not gone by, so let me go. So on the soap. So guys, let me just, I can't, I can't get you guys to move this name. I can't. I can't lose it here. I call it this stupid thing. Tell me not to lose this. Call me crazy for a second, even for a second number. Can't be crazy. So this is for sparse graph modeling. Try to model the functions as a directional graphs, not just like the data. So it's into like a. This is about people that can live and die and breathe, you know? Oh yes. This is just for the that's when I started with the the dental umm, Commission here. I'm going to just start with. So basically, uh, see this image here. Uh, you know, guys, very important and style this concept. This was the four year is it's a qualia, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble. Quality bomb for us now university is a bubble. It could be a square, but you know, it's just the easiest thing to model in the system. So you can get a a bubble or like a point in a 2D in a world at an incident, a place can location go to, you know, can go to detail, you know, but you don't want you can have no dimension to it. Then you get A2 dimension that you know, but that's a circle. OK, Circle is just one dimension. But you know, in our, in our reality, we've got a bubble. So you can go up and up then get whatever the, the, the system, the, the, the time thing is in the bubble. So that's for the mission. So it's a sparse modeling system. So basically time is diluted. In our reality, the this time, but we we get past time, we get only one set of homogeneous time. We can can basically we can we can be observing homogeneous time, but no, it's we're doing hopefully homogeneous. We're not feeling, we're not getting the full sparsity. Tuition to 4 dimensional can't go back in time just naturally in our world, you have to get a time machine to do that. But but we have to go to the the the system measures properly enough in a full reality, which I'm saying. So if time 'cause time is a dimension in this model, you know, but you know it's a sparse dimension and the XY usually if I can go XI can get past X, which can be. Between the 2D world and 3D World, because the I can descend to three world and, you know, comes through it. What is important guys? OK, so my mind I I can see the juggernaut. I can have a thing you can I can talk about chicken. So I try to remember the chicken. I remember the chicken. I have a total of the chicken, but I thought of the juggernaut is like real. It's very good. It's real. So, but that's not a Juggernaut. Why 'cause don't obviously, if the Juggernaut represents an ultimate force, he can run indefinitely. He says the ultimate force, the purpose of doing them. But you know, that's my intake, that's my obsession on him. You know, in the movies, actually, he's a killer. He's a, he's a ****** man. But Juggernaut does not intervene in my real life. Why? Because he's a dead in my head. I can get crazy. I can't get crazy over the Jonah. I can go crazy in a different way. But he doesn't take it from my mind, 'cause he, he, he can take, he, he, he can't, he can't really 'cause he's a piece of he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a fictional. But why is fictional? Because he's a piece of paper. He's in a comic and go and buy a comic and get a good, good junk and read. But the Juggernaut is a force or unstop. Force uh, the stock would juggernaut uh umm. But you know, he's one, he's one I'm the king I'm I'm his controller, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his I'm gonna rock. You know I'm dead. I have full power 'cause I'm a dimension above. So you're gonna can never ever take out of my mind. That's what I'm saying. So if he, if he doesn't want to try to be in my dimension, he has to transcend his dimension and, and come to my reality and be with me and see his comments. And then for him to actually take off my, my, myself, my own body just to transfer another dimension and see all my time. On my days I have lived until see how can change my life with money, but I'm chasing myself without you gonna so I'm busy. He can be unstable for in a plane of 2D physics you Marvel Universe, but it's not simple for it in my 3 world, 'cause he's three world is just my length of my three world. A glimpse of what is getting in this world, which is give me a horror movie editing, maybe scary thing, but you cannot make me think of no matter how how, how, how much I believe he's a God, He's powerful. Basically, I'm the immeasurable object in my reality. But he could be in his superfoods. So when a super force meets a dimensional 3 DIY. But you know, his dimension does not force does not cannot what is influence cannot cannot transcend my dimension whatever force users unless IT projects to my dimension at the bare minimum. So basically something so this is what a qualia. So the qualia system is that. So when you're born you are embryo, that embryo contains 23 chromosomes and 242346 total chromosome. Now. Now you get to have the chromosome 1 and sister more than your brother, mother and sister. So you get half the chromosome. But when you ascend, when you get born, when you get into a game, it's a zygote said when you are like a fertilized egg who's called a zygote zygote. So what you gonna do is you insurance half and half, half and half, half my mother, half a sister that just a piece. I got P consciousness phase one I got which is your fertilized first gamut to me. In that example, so for me to transcend I have to have a minimal of 46 to go to to be part of my system that can take me of the mission, I have to double my genomic. Figures all my cells without mutation and keep me in the system so I can go up to my control. Grandfather some traditional 'cause I love grandfather. So this 1-2 mapping. Of this dimension. So if I want to, if it's like a, if it's a 2D world, the act was only 3D. You have to take a half of 23 chromosomes. So basically half of 2 is like half of 23 is, you know, minimum to basically take. How about to a minimum? So this is how 23 is what? Sorry I'm just trying to figure my hand. 1/2 of 23 is 2025 by two, that's 111.5. 2.50 that's 12.5. So for five genes to be a Mariota minimum to 46, maximum no to 4046 * 2. 40 * 4242 or 46 times 2672. UH-45622. To be imagination and be you know juicy to encoding system. So for me basically the the bubble quality shrinks in half where you come from the hub and you can we get fertilized you have to have half of the other dimension if you have 4 dimension and vice versa you have to double. Vice versa a vice versa if you want to go from today, but you know, imagine this you are you are use a bubble in this world. Physical world is a physical bubble. It's hover about the ocean. Oh, but only the ocean because there's water in this air and it's water and air. This water is fully already. It's it's a water and air. It's meant to bridge your consciousness. A boost drop unit. It is here. Did I keep anything hidden? Did I forget anything? I hope not. I hope I didn't forget anything, he said. Oh, oh, oh, 10-8 minutes. I have stopped. Save it now. Let me put my sweet now. So let me stop this recording, this recording one. Oh, it's like Sue's Loman. Let me stop it now. Sorry, no need. This is what's still my I'll Tell You recording. Stopping by. So that stopped OK. So that stopped OK. Now I'm pretty new recording. I'll start putting this now now. So the the the so so the this is half two to two. So basically basically what I have something that dimension I halfway through. Embryo development. I have to double my speed unless I'll be die so so this is only nine months. Pregnancy is half of nine months minimum to become a stable zygote. So I get nine 9 / 2. Half of 9 is like what, 4.5 months? No 3.5 months of being. I think it's a double. It's so a little bit five months I have 46 times or whatever the standard of 46 times, some 2 after doubled, I would have doubled on the sales in the nucleus. That's the 6 * 2 to become stable, that's 6. UH-2 uh, doesn't say, uh, six times. 2 is 12 now 4 * 6 is 4 * 2 is 82. That will be double at 82 kilometers minimum just to ensure stability and so I don't fizzle out and die after then so I can keep moving on. So basically 82. At 3.5 months now for the rest of the month, 3.5 months at least 2 for five months. Which is the 9? 9 so after just keep going full important that's 82 * 2 Sorry, sorry. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no for the 727. It's miss 82 * 2 is 4/4 and that will be 8 two 16164 chromosomes to needed to ensure that that that you know, I am fully able to function. I've got my features, my human being. My physical form already for the nine month stage you can't basically I don't know Basically if I get the maximum, the minute local minimum 104, the local maximum will be 8282 + 104. I get 4 + 6 that's. Six 8 + 0 is 0 and then one is 6 and 18988100 and 8486 minimum crossword. I need to be just be exact and walk and talk. And then be happy I can put some recording guys 'cause it's kind of like to eat on my computer. OK guys, let me just stop recording 2. So stop this recording number. Arnold. U this one. Come on, you stop this recording. Oh no, it's still cool then. Let's do dropping frames man sorry number so stop this. OK now stop now. I could just show now. Let me just back up this transfer. Let me just let me just close.
Move this computer. Send.If it's easier, have it this one is not recording I I do not close this one. I can just try this one on OK no, this summer this is his ten. She would record a long time, but I don't trust anything so. 3 minutes and my clock out here should rain. OK so basically I've got one. I want to do it. OK guys this video is very important for me. It's basically a video of the willing to do all my life. You know, the pressure of my speech the way I am this way. I've never made a video by I was in that stuff, but basically this video, I must follow it very well. Because so the whole home, delicious philosophy. Heart all and soul 2 connections. My heart and soul 2 connections to world. OK, basically you said ontology, nature and nature of being. Are you asking how does intelligence what things are take the SpongeBob, what we can know about them? Uh, because Beijing films such as the system that's observed advice to find reaction self. Yes, yes, this is like a clothing prompt. So basically, what's ontology? Ontology, guys, is my research instant? Especially what's the whole internal white organisms exist, are placed in the universe, how we know ourselves, how we perceive ourselves. Ontology for me is very. At a quarter, maybe just who I am. My persona Heart to Collections is 1 of what I call polarity and my heart, my person, my, my heart, myself, my good heart and my evil heart. It can be good to myself. I can be evil to myself. But that's like, do I have a hot, you know, my heart is just good at you depending on how how I'm behaving, how I'm feeling. When I'm hungry, sad, angry, that's just that. Could be nature. That'll be nature. The the natural things that happen in the world that affects that cause and effect, duality and nurture. My upbringing, my trauma, my environment, you know? This video is because ontology is the core of this entire framework. Anthology is just not what things are. It's for me, it's never what things are. It's how things are. How are they like that 'cause you know, if you think about yourself, you are, you know what your skin is. OK, basically let me give you a sample. I'm asking so you look at Apple, a red apple. They would rather put is very juicy. Now you take a bite out of that and looks very juicy. It's basically an umbrella. It's red, it's shiny. It fell from a tree, it falls from a fall. You pick it from a tree, you pick the red apple, nothing ticket. And then you look at it. Oh so red. It's so juicy. They're picking up and you bite it and you say, Oh yes, it's the apple. I'm putting the apple. It's a very juicy taste, like I expect like an apple. Then you take a a goose French apple, but it's green apple. So you take this apple and then you bite on this apple. When you buy this apple, it's not really as appalling as I'll taste it 'cause, you know, my focus is me biting apple. I says apple is not. Happily, it's not juicy, it's not. What means what I mean spectrum apple. Now are these both apples? You know, yes, you will say that, but you know my nutrical say yes, but you know I'm autistic. I'll say no, no, no. It's a few different things. Now, while I was saying all you know is 'cause it's a green apple. And this is a red apple. But does we don't know the term apples? Who gave that thing? So we can apple is just a word in English. We got like a other words we can give it based on our anthology. The nature of our being but authority is just more about to me about how we work, how we build, how we process information, our real world, how we how we work, how we went, how we, why, how we. Where, how we, when and that's more about that's architecture as infrastructure. You know, it's about anthology, but what's why are good questions to ask if we don't give you the bigger picture on structure of a syntax? But we we can know about apple. So now you get. So basically now you say, OK, I'm gonna try to get this apple red apple, but give it what classifieds an apple yet. But both apples say yes, yes. Now this is not apples. The ground trees, they have the same process go through the place of life and that the goal is to start the seat. But then you get a tomato. A tomato is a fruit. Yes, yes. And apples are fruits, but tomatoes, what a vegetable. So it it's like to be on the ground, it grows in ground and doesn't go too high. But it's also fruit. So it it's a fruit and an apple. It's a fruit. So it can be in apple clothes and in the fruits Vegas and veg fruits and vegetable clothes. But it's it's different. It's nature is different. It's like, you know, if I wanted to ever. Create an apple from scratch. I have to go. You know, from scratch, but I haven't known I have to get a seed. But the seed has what we don't know what seeds fully made-up of genetics code, protons, you know, but if they capture the full information of what a seed is, so we can get an apple tree. But, you know, that information is so sports and so dynamic, it has to be like, you know, a computationally infeasible for any computation today. But also I'm saying to me, I'm saying that the nature of anthology is the nature of reality. But you know, it's important to of relative. So it's not just fully subjective, it's just more interruptive based on how we are afraid of because I don't know that the word in French, German, apple. But you know, there are other ways to consider this an apple. So basically a limited lens view, undertaker of the subjection. And we have fragmented ecosystems such as countries that change meaning all the time. New Divergent. But you know, that's what ontology means to me. Basically my sense is when I eat an apple, it's an apple. Fourteen to seven. I get basically the seven senses that I have. Seven, 7 + 7 is what, 14? A first and sight, taste, touch. Hearing another crunch of the apple or the touch of the roundness, this, uh, the sight, uh, what it looks like, uh, the, the, the sides, uh, smell, sights, taste, touch, scent and. US12345 senses and then my, my, my perception of that sense of The Sixth Sense, you know, open sense and the 7th really my interpretation of that is so basically if I see the apple, red apple, oh, it's a red apple and this is an apple. Oh, it's about red. This one's green and this is red, but they are the same thing, so. I didn't say, OK, now I taste the green apple. Now the green apple I tasted, but you know, it says juicy, so I'll see. This is not an apple or a full apple, just a little variation of it 'cause then that little difference means, oh, it's not the same apple, it's not the same, you know, 'cause you know, if they feel that taste, that if I should have taste basically. 7 * 7 If I any any division in information I I take in from my senses gives me a full sense of security of that thing 'cause that is different automatically, which is why I don't class the green apple as an apple in the red apple. I know they are apples. But they're not opposed to me in the same thing and the word apples too rated to describe the full experience I'm experiencing. For me, this one means we knew divergent because you know if I start taking up Also for busy, 7 * 7 is 49. Basically 7 union 7 is 9 + 4 nine ten 11/12/13. 13 and then 4564563 senses for. Basically my sense is again 63 dimensions of process 'cause you know the minimum one is 7 + 7, 'cause you know 7 intake and seven relay. So for the five senses, the one I experienced the food for the inverse kilometer sensors. Things that I can act on, I can get 14. 14 and the and the and the cases like A-77 senses. But you know, but you know, 7 + 7 is 1419 two to 69. So we get 69 three dimensions for processing this kind of information. But you know, that is composing so much ways so much ways that that that it's like a accountable. It doesn't really mean that it's. Yeah, one class. It's a static system. It's like, you know, if at least one Apple and then I buy a corner, it doesn't account for all the variations in the world, you know, 'cause you know, it's not static. It doesn't feel rigid in the my in my view, it feels like something is. Experiences of off of queue. OK, next question. So this house basically the next one, this one gonna also epistemology. Now if anthology is what, why no epistemology is what? Yes, how I know about the, but you know, that's more of a classification from don't go to that now let's go to other one. Don't know for the magic legend. So see, I can only taste apples in my dimensions. I'm a 3D being. 'Cause I'm basically I'm a 40 bean, but I know I'm 3D World, so the I couldn't just up as a mower. So I get a three dimensions to taste an apple or fruit or orange like, you know, some kind of fruit less, you know. And then my senses are and then I mean 3 doors. So 3 + 3 is the minimum dimensions you can have in. Three to three ratio 323 means 3 + 3 = 6 six dimensions. Now this kind of proof screen 3. 3 * 3 equals nine. 9 + 6 or 15 no 15 is what not union of it. Sorry is it a British unit? This is union of the five. Nine is 15 so get 15 dimensions. I can be in my relative but only taking my XYZ through my senses. My senses. But you know I can interact with up to 15 dimensions phenomenologically. Cause if I close my eyes, my consciousness extinct. 3 matter. So there are 15 dimensions here in the world. My world student. But you know, I don't need to observe, I don't need to use them. I don't know how to access them. The access is limited because I I don't know if you can try to try to go to meditation state. Uh, Malaysia's street, uh, but you know, down after some of it, I took it seriously. I can try to actual project. Try to go for my will go far and my mom to travel across the plains. But you know, only bound to 15 dimensions 'cause my world is 3D, about a 3D sensory 'cause I see X up to down, you know? You know, 'cause I'm a yes, it's done. Should be done.bout to this person show phenomenological meaning. Uh, OK, lah, uh, if you want to talk, this is just so, uh, the nature of knowing, uh, know yourself, but the nature of knowing all the things, uh, which is phenomenological, uh, lens protocol. So for my also, can I can access this the other 15 dimensions because they are there for me to access, but I don't know how to access them. Because I am already in the framework of this system, What things are related to epistemology? The nature of knowing. OK have my things stopped or no? OK, The nature of knowing epistemology is the same thing. It's just, you know, how do I know what I know? I do know what I know. Sometimes if you can class them, classify them multiple times, so I guess. I could do one way to say 15 dimensions minimum for like access. I can't if I want to access it and then see 3 dimensions for a sensory processing minimum because you know, I've been double that and that's the minimum sensor. So so how do I? How do I know what how do I know about them so I can famous courses? Basically doing stuff can be done in many ways, but you can see a couple of how do I know how am I sure how am I show. I know what I know which kind of personal, so you know it's a valid information stream. So I can give you one more so you can get most code. Now most code is like repeating patterns, you know, but it's universal patterns. So if I, if I look at my ref library and I have most code, I I can accumulate. Sometimes we lane it's it's, it's, it's kind of a incise to me, but you know, we have some sensory protocol that kind of interact with no intercom, but you don't really know to show it is or it is not there. Uh, because I'm saying that you know, it's not just like, you know, I know, I know I can, I can check, I know what I know. Because it's the force into some. A classification he reached clarification, or lack of lack thereof, of it, of a structure of some kind of data stream that sparse. And you know, can switch, you know, it doesn't break myself. And I can classify, 'cause it's part of this music. And more than the discount shouldn't be any form of thought because not the apple or the tomato. Dilemma. What's your future like? The first element or the carrots of the? Basically all vegetables are are fruits anyway, but they grow them on the on the ground. The yam is a fruit, upon the yam is a fruit. Yes, so the person is looking on annoying stuff, getting more insight, you know, but you know, you can use really a lot of relay to classify a lot of verb now. So the verb now actors like that, the verb now of this apple red, apple, red apple. A red tomato. Buddy stomachs are classified as they. They just things like anchor to that thing. No I can change the term red to green apple. Or or or yeah, orange character, you know orange character. But it's like the confusion of fruit and veg. In my world view, fruit and veg 'cause you know they are, they are the same thing but more just more healthy. An easy to grind and easy to process. You can go from three if you give him the car from where you want to eat the car from the ground naturally. But they aren't, they're healthy. You dimension d -, 9. Proved authority from basically. A a new definition for topology. OK, yes, yes, my this is based on me, my news. Basically I am I'm a specialist. I believe I'm ash predicted from this place. From this world, so I believe I was a particular down was because you know, this mythology, I was going to see those. I was in the 40 world when I was born, said we want to give Namdi a chance to be, to be in a 3D World. But you know, that's how to admit to you guys, 'cause you know, I, I felt targeted by my new divergent people that anchored the, he told me my new devices. But I I believe I was down projected from my plane of business for one reason and one reason in order to make a change to the world to anchor my purpose to do something before I join my meet my for this partial space. So my 40 world is like 4 * 4. Four 4 * 4 Sixteen 4 + 4 is 16. In 36. 6 + 6 is 12. 34550 dementia so basically I50 dimensions, but I'm this what I'm 36, but you know, when I was born, I, I, I have a thing basically I was in the hospital and I was able to see everything in the walls, outside the walls, you know, 'cause I came at mom's house in my mum was like a fully born and I think the process all the. Information around me, I knew where the breath let me think, but you know, I said to let go 'cause I didn't really know why, but I didn't quit on it. So I can see what people normally the distance they were in the room. I knew what was going on, but it wasn't me really. Definitions of my head. It wasn't me because of it was making sense of. So that meant that someone was process formation itself. People this, this went to me. This people post information. I can, I can. I was like a baby as a child. I was like observing information indirectly into my consciousness. I was like, oh, why this? And you know what? I wanted to turn off my eyes and not see. I could have done that. What I want to just hear this person's voice. You know, but you know, one of my time is running out. So it's like my time was like I wasn't dilated. It was like a time was becoming more linear, more, less linear, more like I was spending everything on everything is once. But I, I, I just came back to my mom and everything just collapsed for me, 'cause I just wanted to collapse, 'cause I wanted to just. Ice and sea was there myself and everything was easy to understand 'cause, you know, it was more mature with my rhythm, my beats and it was more of formal ontology. So basically the everything dissipated, especially all the signals, which are called signals became noise. What's up the window ontological? I can still access the signals, the phenomenal signals if I want to, but I don't really want to do that for you guys. Now the Frank Stein Jacko problem. Now oh is the down? No no, let me just check this. This should be done. No, It's oh, oh, it's stopped, is it? OK, no, let me just keep on quickly try to the Frankenstein Jekyll problem. So basically use metaphors. Are you trying to argue about Western or design? So basically. The. I don't know. I'm basically they are, they are, they are not fragmented. Usually people are not building ontological cells. You know, they just why you have authority systems. You know, if you polarize yourself through the service, you know, being fragmented yourself. So this is you're the heart of the system. You know, in my framework ontology, you're the heart and soul. If you're writing a code, you are writing for yourself. You know first. You know. But people are stressed. Well, stressed people are working hard. People are looking for proof. You look for money, but not thinking about how this matters in the long run. Especially when it crashes. And also they write code that is a reflection of this spirit and the soul, you know, whether it's like a a business or bank or, you know, the, the rights that don't really align with their vision because the. Me. This is for corruption. It's not about corruption or human indignity, lack of thereof. No, it's about authentic analysis of yourself, your soul. You know who? What are you? Who I am for me. I was asked this question. Who am I? What am I still in here? Why am I? Why am I talk enough? Me. What am I talking about? You know? It's like a it's like, why? Why am I? Why would even bother working anymore? It's even about the work in the morning. It's like it's for me. I don't wanna look at something in the world around me. I can't fully classify it. I can, I am touching my skin right now, but I can't. I can't my my sense of touching my fingers. Or like mine is unfortunate my head. I can't really understand why this is coherent. It's it's like I don't I don't interpret it as a full stream of information like words. By interpreters in the mining sense, it's like a kind of like weird how I troubles 'cause I feel like my forehead is quite a but it's funny. I need this one used to be sweaty, but it's sweating really, but the wheel is not really. Good. It's like, you know, it's back in circulation. It's like a drag oil. I smell it. It smells, smells bad, but it doesn't align with my vision of what feeling a surface of my my head or my head feel like, you know, I am seeing my skin is soft. But I don't know what I should be that way. Graphics, you know, So what seems to this is like, you know, you know, when I'm building for myself, should I build, should I build someone else ontologically or should I be for myself first, my heart, myself, my spirit, or should just accept this, you know, 'cause I'm, I'm black right now if I die. Those cells are gone into, but you know, I think it's not me that did it. It's kind of unless it's proof. So this like I'm doing basically the question here is should we if we could do it? Should we if, if I should, if I can do it or if I can't do something that I consider immoral? It's almost as a framework of anthology. And vice versa, should I, you know, should I 'cause you know, if, if they think you are hostile, they will actually end you. But there's no consensus to that system because there are there. Consensus is a a, it's a again, shows. And other ontological nature Antaglia 5 as part of the she, she said. I don't believe in defense. It's past offensive. At least I saw photos I guess I don't know. OK, so spouse off and so obviously sparse offense is a sparse difference is basically when you defend something, you defend it via phenomenology and ontology. But defense is not a rigid, I mean attack is not rigid. So we can find. Losing your defense ultra attack so 10 about anthology initial self. It's also attacks me. I defend myself once find a way to defend myself. They find another way to attack you. You that defend will be useless. Like I used to defensively be something that's a new or a new stuff attacking or like, you know, if I punch someone, if I punch someone, they punch me back, especially if I pinch someone, sorry, pinch, pinch. If I pinch someone, they pinch me back. But if I punch someone, they punch me, they punch me twice as hard. Continue they understand that pinching is a is just a simple thing you can get over there. But you know, if if I if I punch someone once, they can punch twice as Hawking they they can, they can the the consensus broken. The first one is a pinch. It's going to punch the third one pinch point first. We covered first day of the month. June, July basically the first is like, you know, the the the the the ontological response before on a fail safe collapse, you know. A proactive surety rather than an exhibition now constitutional. Uh, uh, computing and applying authority. Uh, so apply your service. Basically, my, my life has been on logical. I've been looking at myself all the time since 9, since born. Never division, you know what's on my who I am, what can I, what I know, my persona, everything about me 'cause you know, if I was born from an from a zygote, because I go as well. I was born as a zygote. So when I was born, there was a, you know, us growing in the room. So but you know, there was like me and the dog is like a the male and Spanish. Male sperm fertilize in the egg and the female sperm, but you know, this is like a model zygote model 'cause you know, thinking about the models also, if I'm, if I'm a man, if a man, if I'm a young boy, then why do I have autism? A lot of people don't don't listen. What's confusion on my new division? What makes me new or flexible? But you know, my, my, especially my hypothesis is looking. I got fertilized, but it's not my, it's not my. I'm not, I'm not a problem. It's not my, it's not my dad's side. It's my mom's side. His mum's eggs was something. Wrong, but my dad actually corrected and I became more or bipolar, autism, ADHD as well. Just learn severity because there was some kind of an misaligned with intent of the system between the gamut. But you know, the government I didn't have obviously I, I was basically for me, I'm I'm reflecting on myself because I used to observe the stream of consciousness in the real time. I was going to see stuff on like a navigate. I was basically I was, I was basically. Person relating I just popped into reality. If you don't believe me, when I go fertilizer, it's like pop pop and then there's a silence 1D point Oh and then 1D point you come grew, grew, grew, grew. I started seeing a one day point and that and then I and then zoomed out and then I that's even one point then basically pop and you just. You know, uh, X-ray, you know, and then. You know, was it like a light sleep? It's mostly and then I said, oh, I mean, actually let me go ahead. But you know, that's my mind growing my feet is busy for me. This represents my the the the zygote problem, 'cause you know, why do we think probably just like a a little sure that the minister's past. Oh, no, no. OK, then close. Uh, designers, you get me to a meeting. You get me a meeting. It's not even about a game's meeting. It's a if something's new, it can look, it can look itself in that framework of the 3D World. It's just in, but not. It wasn't like. It wasn't like a well, obviously I was pretty sure so it was more of three dwarfs was there. But I came in there from the 4D world reality 'cause you know, I popped into the three world, so I wasn't. So that was like some kind of wave, some kind of sparsity dimension that put me into this reality by grew as a fetus. I could observe my surroundings literally. I can go to go out to people's minds and see stuff and go further in time, you know, as far as my questions can stretch. You know, but I was being pushed up backwards, you know, bootstrap in a way that was like, you know, trying to make me more human. I mean like a making more this kind of person. So I act like a go back in time, 'cause, you know, trying to think back in time and we thought talk back in time. I can access things that happened in the past like. Breakthroughs or work? People's history of work. But you know, people don't believe me, so I don't prefer it. Yes, but that's why I call the encoding of the zygote problem. Because, you know, I'm thinking of if I have an ear system 'cause this is given to ear system to act on a observer, but a system's relatively computational. No matter how yeah, she seems, you know, you can use Chrome logic, you know, it's budget rules. But you know, if you give the AI full consensus to build its own utopia, what would that look like? What what that look like, You know, to me, that's what I mean. You know, if there's a good perfect, what is what is the competition? Of the colors formally so you know if you give it freedom to use all the web interfaces at all. Why say this is because for me, if I can talk to you my own utopian and stuff right now and have a bubble around me my from my bubble 3 so I can never pop in a no matter if I die 'cause my blood keeps growing and growing and growing and then coming in brewery. Go to 1 to basically. Pronto threes pregnancy uh 3 or 4. To 5 or 6 is another pregnancy of the embryo UH-6 or UH-6 UH. 678728 is where you can get one. We can get someone get both 7 'cause they're very good. Well, but in this one, my cycle of it. So if you go to the embryo system. A lot of them the money desk is 1. The darkness one displays one disposal noise signal to noise coherence 'cause you know the signal was becoming noise and the noise could signal and becoming more aware of my going to places and using my mind. This is trying to go. I was thinking a lot of things, just not embryo. But it's the kind of more try to split to me, I'm not a problem means my mom's ex this room 'cause I'm the male, I'm a man. If I ever tell a woman, I'll tell you my dad, there's a room something wrong with his males and I became autistic and your divergent. But you know. But it's not the woman I'm missing. I'm not autistic, I'm not different. Let me see. I'm not flexible 'cause I don't have to tell me your divergent. So this is wrong with me, but it's something up with the process of this thing perception I had. The Academy with as a child, because I don't know people don't have this kind of experiences bootstrap their own consciousness. They're not aware of the metastate being born, which is why I'm really interested in this 4D sporty team one or four 3D recognition. Let me see what. Just now, yes, it's 5. Uh, fine. Uh, sure. OK, UH-5. Wait a second. Could you show me? OK? Thank you. OK, 'cause this one or computer. Oh, oh, this is this one. Stop. Oh, this is a stop. This now 03 minutes. It's not even done. Uh, uh, UH-5 uh oh. Wait. Five. OK, let me still go here. Uh, OK, sure. OK, OK. Basically 5, uh, five, uh, condition, uh, uh, competition condition as applied to authority as your, uh, proof of the authority is just flexible. Uh, is it both? It's philosophical because, you know, we have to look at each of being. To address any role apartments, but philosophy is just not really. Good. Obviously I love Greek mythology, but you don't have a lot of problems, you know, but you know, all of her problems are not taken into account 'cause you know, it seems dense. Dense. I look like the, the, the Dragons, you know, 3 Dragons, you know, those are like a epistemological questions, that of nature, nurture being real. And I found a lot of solutions in them, you know, like, you know, the mermaid. Medusa and other solution. This is anthological problems already. OK, you know you can see you and if you touch the snake you tend to snake you snake you just snake. You turn to stand sand stand to stand a stone sandstone and you consider a statue. Why is a gaze? Why is a Medusa's gaze? Unique. And why? Why does it? Why does her beauty? How is it? What what what is a what are the gays? Only her guess 'cause you know, she's, she's powerful. But I guess turn a man to stone. But to turn men to stone? What's the backlog? Why? Why does she have the power? What does that mean for women later today? You know, women in seas who have Duggars. Is there, is there a real world example of the reflection of the anthology to, you know, of this case in the world of a man? Man gazing, A10 woman gazing. Making a man dead. These are called. What do you call it? Death, you know they call the the something model the something model. But the skin of women can kill people send me to tell this woman dangerous. But they're beautiful with a danger. They do it in an elegant way, like the man, the serial killers. But they are sending fit house, which I love for me to tell us more 'cause they're more aligned with my, my view on the on the on women's nature. And the nature duality. OK, Part Part 1 foundation condition which routine being and becoming in your framework. OK being is is can be survival or living, but being doesn't serve a purpose. It can be a purpose. You know it can be alive. But you don't have a goal, a goal in mind. It's like, you know, if anybody can over sensitive centuries or sensitive stuff, you know, you can't observe the reality, your reality, you're just being. But you get things done whether you do it on purpose or not, you know, but you know, you're like a Alzheimer's or something like that. You don't, you don't fully comprehend your reality. Then you are be in you are in a state of a life and you're a being in that note becoming now becoming is. You have full sensory preservation and you can act on your own intent and your own accord. You know you don't need anybody holding your hands. You know, it's more of you finding trying to navigate yourself and not be. Misled by someone so being and becoming two different things. You calculate a new divergent dimensional or DDD. What is dimensional ontology not mathematically what dimension is being in? Oh yes, yes, basically my, basically my basically, I mean my basically basically my human decision. So you get a 14 to 14 metrics here. So fully transporting is what 14 * 14 or 14 * 1414 * 14 is what? Also 14 * 14 is 196. No 14 + 14 is 28. 28 and that's 28. That's like one of his 89101112. 910-1112 2122O2244 dimensions, for instance, it's like a so you have like a basically I believe I'm from I have to mention 14 minimum because of this thing. I said a 40 burner structure to the 40 dimension, yes. So basically if you want this is a tensor, the 40 dimension is a tensor. Get 2 sets, you get 2 pairs of matrices, the XYZ pair XYZ, XYZ by three by three. So basically get 3 you get a four dimensional 31231. OK, let me try. 1123123. 123123. Almost basically get a a matrix of a dimension for 4D dimension gets a dimension of 1234 is basically get the dimension of. Basically get a 4D matrix. Uh, which is a full by full matrix uh uh uh uh one uh, which is a 4 by 4. You know 312341234. Oh NI Yi GE 16 ah total dimensions you can access a bit which is just numbers 123 and it's which mean extra dimension, Y dimension and Z dimensions, where 3 is just the start. The maximum number can get almost since you this dimensions 4 * 4 and 60 dimensions. Uh, maximum, but it's not 'cause you know, the, the nature of this position for you. Typical authority is the measures mean anthology. The measures means there's partial plane I am in and how my, my, my, my, my. My, my sense is right now in that common frame can be amplified to focus on that actually some kind of thing I can act on and without reasonable power. That's, you know, without question paradox in the whole universe, you know, 'cause if I have a progress means that I'm not going to be in animation and I'm lost. So this they've come crazy. Someone takes on my body like a man hike, you know, but you know, tragedy for that just means the if I see something, can I accident? Am I allowed to accent, you know, that kind of epistemological question. Seen doing a being a conduit of that, but you know, the mission actors have to ensure the whole dimensions don't align with their own objective. Why Beijing specifically? Occupation or basically vision allows competition. Basically get a Beijing intelligence infrastructure. Beijing is allows us to computer if you have like some kind of dimension. I want to access a dimension with the dimension. My dimension has a dimension 7 * 7 which is 3 dimensions. That's my dimension of this 3 by 3 is what 3 * 3 is 9. I have to mention 15 dimensions access at a time in parallel, but you know at the time in parallel I can I can be in one dimension and jump to the dimension. So it allows me to do that probabilistically without causing a product. Can you give a comment about how Obi housing claim difference in UK? Yes, ontological Bayesian infrastructure. Basically it's like. And the, the, the economy is basically I'm thinking of the system of the ontological vision system because they are Beijing, they are, they work on probability. So if I don't. Let's see like a try that consensus processing. So the try it's gonna try that trying to exercise with consensus model. If I don't do something once I'm not wrong, I'm just I'm a mistake. It's a mistake if I didn't if I didn't continue then statement, then I continue to not do those things I probably forgot. Now, yeah, this way we just pick it up and say, Oh yes, don't know you've done it, I've done this for you. They can get on your day and I don't have to worry about tomorrow, 'cause he's tomorrow, but we can do this name 'cause he's tomorrow. They wouldn't give us how three times, you know, we'll fix the problem 'cause intelligence enough to think about my info from my surrounding 'cause it's a dirty bin. I put the bin out dirty. I put it like a rubbish bin. I put the the my my bin but my my my my cocoa bulb or my monster bottle in the bin. Vice versa honey it's like a dirty bottle and the Berry bottle. Just put it wrong and soon can collect it. OK. Her name is gone. Let me try to correct his mistake 'cause you know, that's what I'm saying to do so, Mr. 'cause you know, if I call no question, you come back, I will be oh, do some more work 'cause you know, it's about showing that the system like, you know, for me, I have a bed here, but it's very dirty, so this bird can be tired when I need to. 2:00 to 1:00 to 1:00 to warm up in. But you know, you have to assure that I'm ready to sleep, you know, in case I want to use the bed so you can, I can put away a better way 'cause I like put better things to put themselves away 'cause you know they you don't need it. You need more space for your day. For example, if I have something to go to bed and the bed, I put away 2 to one. Rapping 2 to one just means 2 inputs, 2 inputs, 2 inputs, A&BANB going to and then that becomes a A1 output. So this is 1 mapping. So data is Apple data coding. Then it's a functional method and then that or that one that one inputs. If you get one input, I get 2 outputs out. Like it's a one to one ratio between the two and start with a 11221 on several one. 212-2112. You know, Christian, if I do something once, obviously if I if I have a function that data once again two outputs those type of map to the factors, two factors and those two functions will be passed out of the next two functions and come one apart. But that's more sustainable probability measurement of using if then if then get to the policy. And if then else if then if A foundational and inspirational goals can only try to get this done. Uh, 40 minutes. OK, I go now. Uh, can you give a yes, yes, uh, you could, uh, basically pay compressor. Uh, what's in touch is that, uh, that's obviously authority. That is like, you know, I'm trying to get this 'cause it's, it's kind of basic right now. Don't use my constitution. So basically you are meeting that you are allowed to breathe, but you know people are allowed. It's like MUCO journals M UK or journals don't you know it's position? It's just automatically via the online decoration system. Likemoneyclaim.org. Diaries that something went wrong, the muco journals and the mucous journalism allow you to. A, a collected debt because you operate out to the service and now that will sort it out and then, you know, to stop malpractice in the constitution itself and deter it. You said Britain's officials, what's optional? Yes, yes. It's a basically the breathing is not optional. So you can have like a allowance to land there in your park, in your directory compound. You can have like a cooking lad, you know, a fertilized land. You know, 'cause this is where everything is going. You're meant to be there success sustaining A ecosystem. The the system can breathe itself, you know, 'cause you know you have. Vegetables for, you know, have a, a farm, a mini farm. You can own things at a mini farm, a mini farm in there, have chickens, cooked chickens can cook, eggs you can cook. You can make them right there in the mini farm and it's gonna be happy. You know, you can have pets and dogs around there. That's what you guys have. You don't, you don't, you don't want to get a fragment anything going. Work for this because if the if you're pretty actually going to systems that that don't sustain sustain you, you're paying money, you're going extra, you're not doing your work because you know, they accepted this this 1200 day, there's 12 hours in a day because 12 and 24 are invariants, 12 to 112 to one. Same thing but they're going all the way. So six hours. I want people to work a maximum 6 hours a day which is half day. Drink. I work 3 hours maximum because it's half of 6. So what's the option? As long as not sure You can easily breathe if you get breathing. Breathing is like a breathing doing what you love. Love your work. And then doing things you actually enjoy and then survival. So breathing, you can breathe in and get breath. So if you breath once, you are just a minute, if you breathe and you breathe a lot and you have fun, you know, you know, authentic avatars for people to want to live together. I want to go survive. It's not fun. So when you survive, you're just some life. But you know when you are alive, when you're not surviving, you are living so, so you're gonna live a little bit, live a little bit. That's what the 2 to one are getting. System can help you manage cycles of work, work working so you don't become unalived. Don't you know something about you know something happens, you know you should breathe more. 222 work a day, one break, one book all day. You know, one day, 'cause you're allowed to align with your anthology or your nature being on that stable. Can we close this now? Oh, I'll go for the three minutes. OK, now basically this goes on three minutes. OK, a person. Oh, you breathe. OK, which one should also if I want to, I'm phenomenal, remember. OK, basically also phenomenology. Basically you got feeling memory. Now. Now emotional memory is like a nail, but nail means what not you can have. No type, no value, no memory. But also 512514 is like the one I used. It's a seal of fate. So you know we have like a things that fragment systems. So if an algorithm can track something. Like an iceless whistle and also like, you know, it's like a zip file, a zip filegithub.com, you see. Then you upload it up 'cause you don't have to change that which that is not a problem. And that 22. So I also have two public key and two property or two property. So if you have like a memory system, so basically it allows you to extend the system. So it's like, you know, it's like a nanoid. So you can have like a a. Extension of it so you can look like a low Y and that why can be the end of the nanos and then you can use an enzyme to break the nano bring this and break the here like you know I'm breaking the food down and can use a nano term as long as you join us. I think it's a nanoid. No, I, I, I, no, no, sorry, none of the just the things that I'm doing. It's time that the stems that grow outwards, but you know something else to bind. You can bind them that binds the jeans, the drainer. Let's go to binder and that binder is not the enzymes. What's it called? What's it called? So we get the binding. So basically the the the good of this shop, the system grow as a tree together. So what can citizen breakdown? So the solution is just to show that the memory of the codec system is kind of stuff what it's saying. So when you we combine to other stuff, you you train memory. Of the biology system internal why does why would you be different yes, the research was different that's from sovereignty 'cause I'm going to see my state in a resume looking at purpose of breath up the the the the premise of breakfast must be a reflective beer friend system according to this, you know it must be done according to what I already know. And how the problems are there. So look at that at the my ontological level, based on what I should want vision for it. You know, it's about full immersion with the state of surrounding of that place. A quote, 'cause you know, if this is fragmented and people are struggling, dying, but I don't wanna be accounted for death, so I'm trying. Go back to my contract, 21 years old, I'm gonna work with her to breathe the land and try to integrate myself seamlessly into society that I copier so I can solve the the crisis that I think the suffering I see that I want her child and I've lost contact 'cause you know if I. I wanna go back. I wanna go back to see what it was before. OK. Thank you, guys. Recorder, stop recording. Oh. Active. Someone just tried to deactivate this. This is fine. OK, should be done now. OK, I'm going. Ontological research or an ontological? To the video now include the.
Added to what? My favorite bar that you text. OK, so it's reading now. OK, now do you Let's begin my online lecture. My video should last no more than 25 minutes. Is the fee come here? OK, I think I rather not use the audacity. OK, take photo and start recording. This should be lost. Let me see my alarm clock. 25 minutes start, 3 minutes starts maximum. There we go and then we'll go to auto AI and I should start soon but I don't want to use auto EI now OK, let me just try to start my lecture, OK? Basically guys if it's enough to get stay enough long enough to. Uh, for me to show you the actual cause, apply for. Oh, stop. OK, that means my folders filling up. That means to collect some **** really. But you know, I don't have difficulty. Quantum for the Flash. OK, this one here, I I don't really know here. Let me claim my downloads really on my desktop so I can clear all of this here. OK, now I'll start clear of it. Hmm, I cannot shoot to record especially basically guys in some time. I'm just trying to recycling bin. Let me just empty it empty oK. OK, I'll try again. I don't know what's the time. I haven't. OK, let me start again. It should work. Now start recording. So basically this video is split into three parts, but you know, three parts the minimum. Let's be done properly. Uh, properly too, well, properly done, uh, correctly, uh, with consensus. So let me start with the quantum theory. I have, uh, my quantum field theory expansion, but I got my notes everything here, so she should be fine. Uh, an order actually. So, uh, basically, uh, isn't policy acquisition workers optional? And you know, we. So there's something called a consensus system, consistent means like you know, you give consent, you know you, you give consent, you don't wait for consent after consent, you give consent. So that's the idea of consensus. So it's basically like a sports modeling of attack defense on offense, 'cause you know, this one is autistic like me wants to be attacked. You know, don't wanna be attacked. They don't have to give consent for that, you know. So that's just banning on human rational. I don't know, it's a human being. Oh, do you do you want consent to admit to Turkey and, you know, attack it from attacking them, the offensive from offending them? Obviously if I want to defend myself, I attack them indirectly. So I defend myself and attack someone as autistic. Or new diverges. So I defend myself to give him a normal note to do my best electoral council just to me. And you know, I can defend myself directly by my social worker going to me and saying nurses to me. So basically that's just a spouse model. So consensus means like you don't wait till you to give consensus on you. Actually, you know, it's your right first one to do it so. Based on three, two to one mapping. So basically you have two public keys or one private key. You keep the private key, but I never tell people the public key do the public key don't really care. But you know, the two public keys work on the same data, the same sparse data, sparse defense data, but you know they they rotate. Because they know how to rotate 'cause you know if they are doing either the public keys, they they they only keep the data altogether. But you they are probably you can expose this or until just post it on x.com. Supposed to enter forever, but you know, that's what I'm saying guys, the spouse methods. I can literally just have the keys in there well there forever and they'll be there forever out, you know 'cause they will beat, you know they last forever. But if I have two private keys, you can put one information. I need the information changes. I know, I know, I know it's been tampered with us. So if you wanna catch someone, just put something. Like that in something there and see what they're doing. OK, document is listening. This is my quantum theory model. Oh, I'm going to run around to the front. Nice. This video have to upload it as soon as possible. OK, so this video is on something called my mother of Ponyfield Theory. OK, so basically it's not twice anything coherent. I will start cooking. So you got the coherence operators, which I made A union A is a + a equals to a or and and and because it's union, so it's union set union and #3 union. A + A * A = a ^2. So this is, you know, this is just a model of it. So the operands are plus and times define the union of opportunity, you know, as a coherent system, a Korean quantum system, you know. Don't collapse under the sheer noise of the world. But you know, I then a star actually my A star because I'm giving myself an A star in a quantum physics 'cause I know I saw the problem. I think for myself anyway. All soft streaks are structured. So basically the substrate things are is basically can make it a substrate. You know, if you get all the information you ever need to solve that quantum problem and but you know, that's such a busy that's Cartesian model. So if you can give it, if it gives like a something quite a system like a computer, a quantum computer, the structure to. Of radio waves, you can see radio waves, but you know you don't need to see the whole electromagnetic structure which will agree with this right By the way, so A and the structure is like you know the flexible 1. So if the structure is just the soft structure, it's a substrate, it's a sub structure. So the substrate is a part of that bigger set the radio is part of because of. Of the of the whole internal election. OK, completely guys OK now now for every union there's a non union a district basically just a sex theory union negate there's a disjoint in a you know on a subset of you know gotcha set theory with number theory. Classical number theory and the polar #3 because you know I'm going to give you the most complete example. Precise and accurate measurement of the system. A disjoint a a -, A equals absol. Now, now epsilon, epsilon state is this. So you see this epsilon state normally you see this guy says. This is very important to understand. The epsilon stage is just a neo state. It just means nothing. But the neo state has two ways. The neo means nothing, but what does nothing mean? Nothing means nothing. The quantum field so the field around this is nothing so the epsilon field for a A is nothing so. It can be radio waste. Rent money equals rent money. What is the rent money? It's OK. Rent rent when you pay rent. Truck rent, rent money rent. When I rent an open truck 'cause I'm using for example, rent for radio is M for microwaves, rent money, money for microwaves, microwave ovens, microwave signal I for infrared, indigo for infrared, I for inner is visible. Visible spectrum. The light we see visible. You can see the waves, you know the color, everything. Uh, that money is visible under ultraviolet X for X-ray. Ultraviolet cancer detection. X-ray gamma rays. X-ray my bones like a. Some reason ultraviolet, you know things we see in the sun, you get ultraviolet lace you can get burnt by the sun. You can get especially when they put cream on 'cause you know they affect the cream if you turn too much, you turn it so you can use auto rest as you want to get you turn your ultra extra Violet the the X-ray bone for the bone. Both to see your calcium, uh, Gemma rays, you know, Gemma rays or radiation. This can can cohere the whole biological system. Uh, they get from the it's uh, uh, uh, showed in you from the wave. I'll come up to urgently you from the wave with epsilon, uh, encoding state has to be defined properly. Before you even started. So I'm going to give you that the the the the model here. So for the this train set a not a a -, A is epsilon a. Just read yours. Just radio waves, not even like radio waves. What do I mean by radio is you can basically it's not visible lights. Now it's about radios. This would be once you go to the start, start thinking about other things in our lives within our lifestyle, rejoice. So radio wave is like a interactive other radio wave. So basically I see my channel. Was not a perfect tune. It's a good static in it because as soon as channels I'm I'm disconnected from the I'm trying to tune out. But the Channel 2 is not perfect, but you know it's it's trying to tune in and out of the whole and try spectrum. Another problem with the radio system, it doesn't think about the radio. Run later was alone. He has to focus on tuning out. Literally it's, it's working. Basically, the digital system does not decode it coherently via the content principles. Basically, digital companies can do it, but, you know, we don't really think about that. We want to move our lives, you know. So I'm making my own radio to do this 'cause I'm really bored of this. So my goal is to make my own. So I can hear you forever in cars now. What's a while ago? I get a radio signal. OK, so red ship, we are moving away. The universe is expanding simple stuff. Redshift. We get more red waves. Sir, why this matters? Why this matters? So a A -, A is epsilon a. 00 if I 2 - 2. There's nothing, but I'm nothing is something. Nothing is something so, but the system has to encode it still at some nothing, so we get 2. Basically you get EE, you get an epsilon state, which is nothing, a good epsilon epsilon. Of a also, you know, epsilon, epsilon A and then obviously there's no state and there's no transition that's a nil and IR. Now do you remember that? So basically the nil of radio encryption, you know, basically starting a radio wave have to tune it to an angle 'cause you have to tune to something, but you know the system's rotated basically so. If not, you need to something what you need to do nothing. I'm trying to basically the other spectrum, you know, 'cause there's nothing to do this. You have to go round, round, round around, you know. So the district A is Neil, Neil of research and you know, that's the big one of the minds of this league. There's a clamp function. OK, but B is what human sees. I am measuring A. So this is. Measurement problem. So I want to what measure BB is a rigid channel, but you know, I'm from A. But my basically quantum principles superposition, I don't really have to go to A to B to tune it in a 'cause it's just there. I'm just a fine B, you know? That no, I, I'm dead. I'm only there in the metaphysical, uh, in the radio is, you know, if you can find greatest, I already know where I'm going when I'm listening to, you know, you can see, you know, there's no information to the code. It's just the whole structure has been given to me. But you know, I'm basically like a fortune. I'm looking at I'm, I'm looking this way, but you know, the I'm looking this way, but the photos come in my. Isis with the lights, the lights come in with when I when my life goes into this way and I'm the I I see you guys, you and I'm in the in the future. So like, you know, I'm seeing myself here, but the photon is just I'm going this way. So I'm saying to you, dude, it's kind of a polarization heuristic depth. So the thing about defining A polarization or polarity polarity. But you know, politics work on heuristics, but this heuristic equity bound they, they like a competition equity. I don't like the time competition equity. I like the time 'cause it depends can be free. It doesn't. I, I need some I need some equilibrium, computational equilibrium because you know, the system basically I'm seeing this, I'm seeing the computer, right? I'm not get I'm the computer. See me uh can't see me because nothing there's nothing observing my state. You know 'cause you could, you know if you could see me yes, yes, it's gonna my, my car can see me, but you know, there's nothing measuring my state to make me basically I can. Lucy, this was the probability is supposed to induce. If I tune into the radio, I am tuning in and out of of channels, but this channel is open along with but you know every channel has a message when I broadcast me and the message can be. The actual information I'm getting from the system. So once this you guys, you know, it's a cause and effectuality. Do I, You know, for this system to work for the whole radio channel, there has to be some kind of a uniformity, uniformity amongst originals, you know? 'Cause you know the you know everyone shares 1 channel. Then it gets like start to get some noisy and no one can hear each other. No one can find anyone hear anything the information of B. So a I'm trying to go from A to B is opposed by glimpse. Basically I can glimpse at B and try to get information. But you know, it's not perfect. So my system just then I lose access to a So that's what I'm saying again, obviously I'm gonna be oh, why? What can I find be against the strategy? Like I think it's more stressful 'cause I guess probably. So I'm, I'm thinking about the stress of my life as an energy to the strain of the. Try to measure something it doesn't know or does not stop 'cause you know, I, I just, I, I wake up, I, I hear the radio, but I don't know what the radio channels are. LBC station, NBC News, NBC. I don't know what they are, you know, I just tuned them. I can find them sometime and I know what, but you know, the digital phone, you know, I can find you can switch channels as well. We can jump, jump, jump, you know, but the idea of that to make something, get something out of this channel. So I can't find that Channel where everyone is. So basically. The information is not really my concern, you know it's where I'm operating. The field of information operating the substructure is where I'm looking for. I'm looking for. Basically you can models as a Morse code, namely Morse code. Basically you can use Morse code them to to predict ahead of time. You can direct it symbiotic evolution with C, not get an X or Gates. Uh, basically seen those gates are for, uh, modeling, uh, system that are, uh, system that can go on or forever. So basically X my a not. So basically can get a glimpse out of system, but you don't get any information that you want out of it. Can keep learning from that information definitely, but I just won't give you nothing, next to nothing because she doesn't want you to hear my eyes see you seem like a you at a position. Basically, I can see you on your phone 'cause you know. It's enough of but you know I want to see you in real time. You know, it doesn't matter where you are. I want to see from your eyes to your eyes, you know, from, you know, but I don't know where you are, but we live in the same place, you know, especially the address is not we, we live in the same place. But I wanna know. Especially time is an element of this 'cause it's supposed to affect quality. Completely given my childhood memories back, I'm going to nearly fixing my childhood. I just think about stress may or may not the one basically. OK so the problem is A is a substructure of B. But B can be a radio wave too, you know, or not you know, can be a poison in A or corrupt. So basically can be a noise or signal can be a incomplete signal, but doesn't get it. I'm not getting the full picture where the location channel be what's hurt? Is it like on 1000 Hertz, 180 Hertz, 1000 Hertz, 100 Hertz is the standard. Signals but you know I think this way I think that's able to see label didn't change it to 2080 Hertz you know just for reality check you know please don't find ABC News and where they are now airplane basically you have to find some kind of a a a bidirectional no tridirectional consensus and coding system so I. Pull information from FB without knowing what B is. But if B basically I'm thinking of it like further Ali systems. So basically if I have like AABB doesn't need to give me give me all the consensus to know where it is. Uh, to not know, uh, basically, we can give me two sort of consensus, you know, uh, based on a superposition. The first consensus is labeled with the BLBC can give me is what, uh, what? Uh, we not, we not, we never in this, we never allowed this to go in this formation, you know, before even look, before even try to find. Whether you are never allowed to look this place 'cause I will never be there, you know, 'cause you know, it doesn't make sense looking there. So this is like a religious 100 heads to 180 heads. It's like in my boundary. So I would never jump to 'cause we just see some do it 100 Hertz to 180 Hertz. I just don't think, you know, that's more. Position, if you want to pull position myself, polarity after the fight, some kind of clamp function that never exceeds its boundary because you know, that's what they're buying, that's what they're buying. So polarity. Give me so I want to super, you want to connect with me, you want to never never be out of bound out of bound between 180 very important guys understand that hurts hurts, which is the frequency of hurts. For me, Joyce, and then splitting entanglement for you to connect with me, you know, you have to like call in on this phone number. You know, you can speak on your own. So that's what you can really. So you can this one, it's like a, it's like a metadata, but the metadata is just a phone number. So like A and interference. Constructing from it different from it's basically they have to work on a quantum principle for you to speak to me, speak to me on my phone. I'll be see after calling on this quantum phone number. You know, this is like a it's like a I'm in this and it's like a bound to the one of the 18 to allow me to jump this if they go for one. Uh to uh wants to to UH-186 I want. 100 to 101 hundred Hertz to 18180. Which one is I do 175, there's some kind of something including function, let's call it Moscow. Basically I don't refer anything in Word 'cause you know, I prefer functions. Basically the most code has some pattern to it, but that part is it's not easily. It doesn't give you information for information is like a mixing more flexible for everyone. So you can define common 2 to 1 topology, so. Two public keys 'cause they have particular channels, they, they don't give specifically gives a public, two public private keys. So we don't know where the channel is, but they keep one public key and you know, they give us the full consensus to find us for the policy. And how does it work guys? Very well, guys, you do this right. Let me try to compute it now. Let's intercomputed 'cause you know, I love computers basically because 180 has a 100 Hertz again to 180 Hertz Hertz. So you get it. So you get like a like a basically you get a 2 to one, they give us two, we get, they give us, they keep what, two public keys? So he was recently the shuffle, the shuffle, I'm gonna shuffle twice and give us one output. So basically if it's a random shuffle, you know, random shuffle, they give us 100 to 188 and then a shuffle. And then I'll be in this zone. I must basically. Pick a random piece of pick a random. Basically, you know, can start with randomness and become something else. You know, this is a random generator, but you know, let's get towards evolution. So that's what I'm saying in that, you know, you don't get, it's not magic trick. It's like a magic trick in real life. Basically, there's no magic trick in this computer. I have AI have a 2 random numbers 22 probably you have two. Is you keep and you have one private key, so this can be two Morse code or two numbers. Two number AAA2A. OK, what's a? 800 between 180 or two, your two numbers 24 + 6. Oh yes, yes. So so there's two numbers you're gonna give you as based on the map. And so if I, if I did a district things that don't don't wanna do so let me just do a drink district first. 100 and a hundred 280 Hertz and now would be the maximum district from this would be union 100 a hundred 100 digit 100 + 80 plus. 100 one 80 + 100 equals what? Under Hertz? This is I'm not allowed to go past 180 + 100 is what? UH-280, No 280. Oh, sorry. Nothing. Let's say joint OK, 180 minus OK, basically 100 two 180 is just rounded. 180 minutes is a month 80 -, 80 hurts. 80 most 80 years, but you know this is shot from talking about so all that never matters. Order never matters what you have to do the basically ******* fly. 180 a 100 - 180 Hertz is a valid. Which is the first answer. So if you get 2 numbers 1-2 numbers 2, this is. 118 key 180 hurts and now, now flip it now 100 no 180 what -100 is what 80? Never be more channeled 80 -, 82. To. -80 Hertz 2. 100. No must Etihad's uh and and, uh, so 'cause and uh, 182. And 82 my 8280 hearts I'll never be in that range. So don't search me that, but I have to get somewhere will be so. I'll be here. 100 especially 100 plus or eighty 100 + 180 is what So OK, my completion of calculator guys, it's annoying me so this doesn't keep me calling to you before this now. Let me try to do it properly. Actually, this is this property, you know, this is our our na GE. I want to talk to Chocolate Steam restaurant again. OK, basically it's not stopping now, but if you do is trying to get over just again hundreds TO10018018 give me 186 and I do a -, a disjoint minus on. 100 plus. 100 -, 180. It's -80 -, 80. 2. 180 minus. -100 that you bought. 100 uh. 180 miles off I basically get my 100. Basically you get my hundred 180 -, + 100 -, 100. Because you know, basically plus 100 question plus 100 question. You don't flip a chicken, you keep the plus you know 180 must 180 + 100. That would be what -126. I'll be not in. Oh, no, sorry, I'll be busily -180 my. Well, it's 180. 100. OK can you do properly so i'll do them properly might might as well 100 + - 1 828280 Hertz. Sir, I'll never be in the 280 S range. Oh, sorry, uh, 100 -, 180. 8I would have been 80 and I'll flip it the other way 'cause they're thinking about where I'll be. Oh, don't be -180. Uh, this is UH-080. So I'll never be in the 80 Hertz range, 80 Hertz, because, you know, I get 280 Hertz. I've never been in 80 Hertz because I get 280 Hertz, 280 Hertz. I'll never be there. Never be. Don't start, don't start with them, you know, but that's just the state of lobbying. Uh, but this is such a that's just too much too. But this is just the first. This is the start. It doesn't mean to start. Now I get to where I'll be. So basically just get 2 numbers. Oh, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Oh stop. OK, that's the start of the range now do you 100 + 180? Is what 180 Perce UH-180 a bit? The start of the end is negative, negative. So this is a positive and it's the positive. It's end of the start. This is the start of the end. So you get start end. So you get the the end of the start. What do you start looking for me and get the start of the start? Of the range so if I get it and now being oh this is not be the the version so I can do 100 divided by. 'Cause you know everything about all the things that. A whole new divide by eating 100 / 180 is what? Oh oh it's 0.5. And that's the start of the start and they get, they get only developed by 100 and that'll be what 1 penny, So I'll be 0.52. Eight, I will never be there, never be there. I will never be there. I will never be in 0.521 point. A channel or something else going on there, I don't know. This is something going on there and you know, and they get the other one of the stuff. So 1035 hurts to point 1.8. Obviously when you get the 80 to 80 Hertz because you know you flip it 100 -, 1, it is 80. He had to so to eat and not be stopped. 0.5 to 80. Look for me there mean to Max, you know, for LBC now it can be 18618. But you know, we just want to change everything, the whole thing, you know, let's combine new things, you know, we'll just keep it simple for now. Now let's continue. So where would I be? You know what would I be? So I would conclude a union set. So all the things that union union. Equals AB squared a ^2, a ^2. I'm looking for what honestly, I'm gonna have a key here. Obviously, that's the first key. That's just the standard key. This is the seed, the real world seed for just like a seed. So if you wanna, if you don't wanna see me, you start from here 0.5 to 0. Here, but this is just for 2.5 to 3.8. We can find the 55555528080. Do you prefer to eat? Don't look for me here. I'll never be there. But you know I'll never be there. So that's the first one, 218. AT Hut and that would be the normal standard fee, but that that's the full thing basically. So what I'll do now is a union and. Something called the the the if I'll never be there just to be a negative equivalent of it. So you know, so if you flip all the operators, that's a conjugate. So basically if I'm never at, if I'm never here in the positive 10.52. This is a -1 the one. That's the one. Case for me to be so. So that's the positive for some again, so I do the same thing -100. 100 So this is good 100 Hertz to 180 Hertz, but now the opposite would be 100. You can't get it's called a conjugate, the flip conjugate 100 Hertz. 2 -, 100 Hertz. If I do. That. Uh, uh, so you get a A -, 100 to 100. So it's -100 so how much? Hundreds. Plot on 100 + + -, 180. We'll make it 1 -, 118. -180. So to get this. 100. I don't know what. My phone basically 100 plus what's uh oh, so this is that's the opposite 1. So I'm trying to unify. So this is the opposite one with the unification of it. Uh, but you know, it's not basically I'm basically going to new one, go to first one. I've been here the QA 1. So I'm going to be here, but you know, you get to flip the other one. So I'll be in union. Dish union, Dish union, type A, type A discovery one. But can you get one with type B? You flip on it. So this will be the disunion. So that would be a -, 100 Hertz. 2 with the range of a -1 ET. And that'll be the dish unit. This is gonna be like a -, 118. Hertz plus, you know, no, basically you calculate the minus because you don't calculate the addition. No stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm just start again. So you get -100 minus what? Because you keep the negative sign 'cause you minus the minus what -180. A + 180 so that'll be minus plus plus. Minus is minus, so minus -80. 11 minus plus or plus. Minus or plus is minus, plus is minus. Minus plus means minus is a -, a -, a minus. 118 so you never see me in the range plus one eighteen 0.52. 80 and then a A1 this union one, this unit and then a you did this union B, you know you can this unit B. You never see me in the range of plus 180 and above. To the other one conjugate other thing. So basically the spacious is kind of a circle can be he's a he's a pie to come the number pie to computers. You know, 'cause you can come to the area we can see in the field of view or we can compute mathematically, you know, but you know, opportunism, you know, this is more theoretical now, but you know, I'm gonna just get it done. So, so that's -100 you said you get. One district A 0.522. To 80 Hertz and then this string be. Uh, would be uh. 180 hurts 3. Uh, that's a + 182 watts. Uh, uh, rupee 5, you know, 'cause that's this is the, this is this is checking when so busy. This isn't, this isn't like this is just a, a opposite of it. But you know, that's just a different A&B of the radio wave, the radio wave 1 and we got the joint that's union 1, union B union. Oh, sorry. Of B 'cause I'm a union B, Union B. So union B will be the same thing. But where I wanna be? So union B will be what, 100 again, 100 to 180? Well again. And then union B would be union B, Union B from A. We'll find way. Union B will be where ATB. So I pick another number, where do I be 100 to 180? And then I say, OK, where do you want me? I'll be in this way, but give me some kind of random. So this is a big, this is like a subcategory. So it can be some kind of two numbers given to you. This entanglement, you know how to entangle yourself to this signal. Here and stop the order and this kind of order noise, it can just be basically the metadata has been given already. This is the a, a like you know the to me a there's two keys, 2 keys, public key 1 for me. Just listening. B probably B A/B A/B me, can't you and you say I get my own personal mind can be like in a a Jew ideal something that's referral to me. So to be I can be like a a a like, you know, the same. Basically, I can pull up two numbers too. I can put like a let me. 2 numbers are 25, Christina. That's a big range and. 10 because that's with two keys to heal each other as business pass models here trying to prove overseal OK the AUA for R for U for or umbrella R for Romeo A for alpha CL I cannot seal steam so basically I can now define. I want to find it, uh, the way basically, there's no way I'm gonna be, uh, something I wanna know this. I can't be here. I don't, I never wanna be here. Something I wanna know so I can see this somewhere else. Umm, based on the seat evolution thing and keep the private key my reference to it. But you know, I'm seeing that that's how it works in the real world. Umm here, let me try to do it so basically the can be can stop. Isn't it just I never want to be someone I have to get some. Let me just give myself 25 and 10100 + 25125 Hertz is what 125 S my key my seat is what my personal seat is 25 Hey and then you know you have to work with some operation. Umm, union, uh, uh, union. UH-25 let's give you uniform. I need 50 Hertz range maximum so that'll be 150 Hertz for my key to log in 150 Hertz form 100 from the zero. So basically zero to 0.5 to. It hurts. I'm allowed from here if I start a group of five Hertz, I'm allowed to be plus 5050 Hertz, in case anybody knows in the channel on that Channel, on that Channel, that Channel of analog channel. So I can get 50 ahead to get 2 keys, 25 and 25 extras. I get 50 keys total 'cause it's not it's not a digital channel, it's an analogue channel, so. This is just not gonna be on the channel, but cannot be if I want to stop. If I want to close my account, I'll just close one of two both my keys to rejoin and then we go shopping. So I can move this shaft, move this 3.5 here. Plus 50 if I'm dynamic. If the argument is dynamic but you know it's gonna but you know that's plus. Now the plus one. Now I get the 2 keys. One keys were the public one. Public one given to me. Uh, basically, just basically, OK, one key, it can be 25 or two keys 25 + 2550. If it's two public keys to one. If it's a private channel, really private channel 'cause I need one more public key, we can get two public key 50. Now let's keep two public key 25 * 2. 15 so it can be. Keys and log into a private channel it's LBC at any time 'cause it's public, you know you know if I have any consensus I wouldn't always feel. So, so basically my goal here is to entangle my sticks with the field. So basically the whole idea is if you're watching it, you are everyone's a **** and a **** and a buck. So I can be I can what? I'm basically if I want something there in a coin channel, I, you know, say I don't really have to. Give consent to open it. You know, I don't have to say this. I don't know if it takes you. This is my thing. Send it now. You know I would say OK yes, this actor was mine. Says I'm there forever until some until. This is called polarization. So this configuration, I see my stuff, I'm always I my stuff. But you know, if it's not, if I close my eyes, it disappears. You know, if I ever show my, my public key, it's appears 'cause you know, 'cause you know, no, I'm the only one opening my eyes to see that Channel. You know from LBC polarity. Basically polarity is just the concept of like I start with this, I start with this combination, but you know, I start with the combination XY. But XY implies order order X to Y but I don't give it order. So why not just want to X, you know, from going down, down. Time is done, but doesn't mean anything. So down if you need down if I'm going down, going down the stairs, you know, going down the channel, there's no actual channel to go down, but this is channel this up and down in the way spectrum the wavelength, but that's not. Thing that you consider you go a latitude of the way you got the the wavelength and the wave amplitude, the amplitude that the amplitude, the frequency how how much isolates you know. So the wave amplitude wavelength is like the the the. Street of the structure, the wave amplitude is how that structure also got oscillation, which is the up and down of the string. And you know basically it's just frequency and frequency is just. The station you're tuning out, you know, basically the system is bi directional. There's no cause and effect principle unless you. Involved because you know it's instantaneous. So this is entangled 'cause you know every wave remains coherent because there's the natural who can heal decoration. They have a way that the information propagates and distribute uniformly. Uh, with no effect to its cause. Uh, for example, I kinda, I kinda, I can, I can, I can go to a YouTube channel and then my YouTube channel and then for me, I can observe my YouTube channel directly. Uh, uh, direct confirmation channel. And then I'm trying to send a picture someone to my mind, but that picture will not just go in my head, you know? Oh. If I want to tell someone to see through my someone should I can say OK go to YouTube channel? I'm thinking now very poorly now. After, when I close my eyes, I still see my channel. No one can, no one can go there 'cause, you know, given that part, 'cause there's no consensus there to read that document. It's a pointer problem, 'cause, you know, it's called a point of location. It's a point basically, if you have a photo, a folder, a folder, B&A has a soft folder. A a AA1 and a BA2A2 But those two ABA 1A1 and AB you get BB1 and B2 isomorphic. Then it's not really no use for hierarchy. You know there's no basically, if a promo condition files the source of problems and A2 contains some files that solve the same problem solve like a the recovery of the problem it too. And then B2 does BE1B2 does the same thing. You know this is spectrum model cause citrinus 'cause you know it's not. Linear, it's not. It's just categorical, you know? So basically if a one is equal to A2BB1 promising B1 like, you know, I think I take a file and I drag it to B1. Now B1 does the same thing. To A and you know, then, you know, do you know this one? And then that file is then and doesn't need to operate on, you know, 'cause you know, the file doesn't need to recover this automatically back into Bing. But you know how this works. Listening. Well, listen, this is completely. If I copied 2 files in two computers, I get a pointer to that file. That pointer is done, it's just to show the show hand file. But that show comfort is just a like a like a like a the minimal, the conversion of the. But if I didn't see the conversion in the hierarchical E1, it has roots and then I get AB1. But B1 has usage boots. B1 is children but it's basically B1 is a brute of its own. But you know B1B1 is a root of A1 and you get BA. 1 is a 2 and then a two folder and same hierarchy. I should route 2 so to get route one and route 2, you know this can be the same as B1A2A1 where B1 is rich and B2A2B2A2 is rich. So basically this. That's kind of heterogeneous problem mapping. So if you ever use A1 to B1 to A2. Of points and mismatch. Basically if I ever try to move B2B1 into on top of a one and then you get a diamond busy. This is the same thing in model begin diamond dependency issue. Entire system is not conscious. So basically something has to go 'cause you know you know something has to be removed. So this one. Question is a system being homogeneous, I'm working linear principles. It works on signals and the signals are can be go go, go, keep going, keep going, keep going based on the field evolving view into to keep inconsistent principles. You know 'cause they just just like a give no consent to act just. I need I knew I did this now this one. Oh, 14 minutes install. Umm, I don't believe I see a priority property. So basically PA is just property of a, uh, just what I wanna see. Uh, C&B. But you know, I basically I'm AB right now, but B does, I don't want anybody to see me. So why do I see? I just, I just calculated my probability of someone being where I wanna I am on LBC and just remove them. There's no one there before I go there because he was on there then someone's listening there already. So when I when I have the public keys, you have two keys. I go there. I said no shop one key and then I think he won. He wonky. This is I observed my state observed only my state, my, my speech, you know, and then keep all the key isolated. So this afternoon comes. Epsilon, now epsilon means no state and no transition doesn't mean the key is not valid. It just means I'm not using it. I'm not using it. So I keep I keep the door shut shut so you know, and I do my communication with my own private key. I really had a channel back into where when I if I wanted to start, you know, but you know what I'm saying so. 'Cause obviously the keys can be two bubble keys. Now the keys are public, public only. So you get the key can be in a rotation. So you can I can I can I can send my public key. First one public key I can get authenticated. Get authenticated and what uh, this is quantum zero trust principles, DKP, uh consensus principles easily ZKP uh file or compression a few governments hierarchy systems, uh business partition the the defense attack and the offenses so I can get, get some. And then log into the private channel, let's call it some of these properties. Oh, oh, oh, which is my channel? And then you are what? A triangle or square? What are you? You are like a bubble. So you are your bubble. You come to my big bubble. I didn't say, OK, by law, shut off your property key. Give me one properties I give you back when you want to leave. You know that's not what I want the time. So I said, OK, you can stay all the time on the friend. You can still tell forever. Just me want to shut off, shut the channel off. Wouldn't press this button and then, you know, just and then I'll shut our communication, but you know, that's like a then and then you know, he said yes and then we can you can come in and I can give you the concept to shut off anytime. So you can come in first and shut up we can get or I can shut you off at any time depending on how it says something high creation so. Actually shut up. Oh, oh the bubble. Oh oh, anyway, two way. But you know, this must remain this two way coherence based on the coding system. Basically, I can start, you know, even with traditions. I wanted to speak her blue shirt, but so I'm doing a Quantum wave 11. Let's look at this hard. But OK. Pelosi is still about nothing. So basically, you want to pull out something, want to be be with nothing, want to be in a zone, click. You want to be in the zone for that buffer. It's like, you know. Or the thermal shield, or let's call it electromagnetic shielding. But you know, if it is a wave, then it is dramatic. It can be pressured, the wave can be pressured to that radius. Basically, we can go bust if it's a classic system and Speaking of signals that doesn't need, but you know, it's like thermal shield. It's basically thermal shield is like a facet of all of this anyway. I can shoot my way in his thumb away, 'cause I I made a challenge, but you know, the channel doesn't snow remain coming here from everyone once you shuffle it basically. So just a concept that you know, I shuffled the stock coherently show myself. It's consensus amongst everyone. So I get consensus, big consensus, and everyone happened basically like a the force equals mass operation. Everything is something I have to put one second, guys, let me just pause. OK, so nominee, continue your work now. OK, OK guys. So basically the consensus is bound to the system constitute of dry dark composite system. Try the system of social structures first. Socially chemical systems, because the socials are just a system. I've got some writing here. It shouldn't extend one hour 'cause I was talking to upload. So basically I can model it in two ways, three ways actually to give some consensus, but you know the two ways only if I want you to be secure consensus. So there's a two kind of one to two mapping. So the one to two mapping is. Heath and two to no for the blue keys for the Aurora sales, but this opportunity because you know this you guys should now so this I can see this here this year. I'll just read it out to you guys. So you got to define an encoding a nail encoding the nil is nothing, no memory. I don't remember anything you said last time, only log it in. New memory cause new state, new state? I don't remember anything. But this is for the new arm absolute arm epsilon. Uh, to positive, negative. So basically the the negative to positive are just conjugates together. The positive, the negative to positive -2 plus. Radio signals and you know, liberty huts and then you get the union and the union on district. So if on a if on a start a union, the additions First off in the district union. I'm trying to connect to what's already connected to why I remembered, you know, because start from the. The dishes, I never know you and then I I'm trying to connect with you for the first time. So I have to get you. This is this is some the current model. So like you can see the disjoint are like a union. It's just I'm connected to you. I've seen you before. Let's continue talking. And the addition first is a kind of do I want to continue? Let me just continue this. I just wanna do instruction radio with to ensure that the light is, but I'm using the final model because, you know, there's no cause and effect that happens. Then you've been plugging A functional time 'cause time is not really. If you're not optimistic time the time 'cause time's auxiliary too. So I can say I want to maximize my time anytime. Basically, time is infinite, the reader is infinite. You can take an uncomfortable infinite set of time using a pie 'cause you know it is. You know, it's kind of funny. I'm thinking of redshift because we're moving away from the center of the sun. Moving away from the so-called center, but no center. So everything just relative to me. So I'm trying to say that, you know, do you just expanding from relative point of view, it's not absolute center to the universe, which can, you know, so this can improve with this model basically. Well, the rest of the model is the rash of I am moving away so I observe more larger, larger waves, you know, so the smaller waves are the father. So and what I'm looking down the spectrum looking at red, red, red. Now I'm observing the the things that happened far back, you know, but you know, far back things I feel further, further, further should appear more red. You know, if you wish was imploding rent money is under Richard of your gear button and thing there's no water to it should be violent, but that was wrong. But you know if you get blue shift or sign shift, I think it's a red money is a visible under extra glasses, which radio waves. They get. Rent money. Why do you believe Roy Violet is the last color of the rainbow? But that's not why he's supposed to be missing. You know, if it's I don't believe leaving that metro kind of because, you know, if the same or something for each other. But if all everything was passed, I mean, I can never evolve and adapt so. Dumb and somewhat true but not fully true, which I say, don't want to buy these guys, I'm a kid. Then we go here. Basically you have like a a divorce basically you got the posting code in plus force, the standard stuff, but you know, you get the plus and the minus force and you get it get 2 positive force. You get a a positive negative force. You get like a negative plus force equals plus Massachusetts plus force equals negative mass solution. Err, because of conjugates. You know you can take a positive force and get a negative and you get a negative Max in the equation and you get a negative force and get a positive. Next force equals 0. Some of the rest stays at rest. But you know 'cause it's called Nets. It's basically the official, this is just next. It's just the uniform for that withdrawing next. So I could just call it next, next force for that question. If you want to interrupt so you can, you can have some thermal shielding, let's call it children, let's call it spectrum shielding or like more radio shielding. And that stops people literally using radio to pick out radio channels and decipher the message. Because you know, New Orleans radio spectrum radio show, then you don't really have to think about the radio is for the coin system, but tracks and models very badly. But it's the Blu-ray, so basically there's kind of a. Into it 'cause you know, if ever further conquerors, you know, it's 50 minutes now. OK guys, let me, oh, let me, I can't put on YouTube 50 minutes guys. I have to end it now. Now guys, I'll continue my messages. Thank you. I'm so smart man. OK, let me just try to. Consensus. OK, now let's try this problem. Uh, so the worst problem now, OK, uh, it should be done. Uh, let me try to stop.
So basically I've started dictating to my computer what I need 'cause, you know, and I need to disclose something here. I need to mute everything to write stars. OK guys, you can hear me, but I'm trying to. OK, basically Yup, I can do to my computer anytime. So basically guys this is a very important here. You understand what I'm doing now, but I need you guys to really get with it. So let me try to start now. My videos OK basically I've fixed my camera. I'm seeing my camera now. Can you hear me yourself is good to go. OK, so I've got the some notes here, but you know it's all for my head. This is like this morning what today's date is to the 3rd of November. Start orgasm. I work too 'cause you know what is the workplace? They just like people work. But you know, I put them down on people. Get to the next. But this time it's gonna be a serious thing about my civil collapse initiative. So we got a triadic models only. But you know, every new system has a trigger model. So two things basically, you know, three teams, Muslim people here. Basically this is something I told the wingman between there's no, there's no sun shining on it like, you know, with you at the sun. It's like a, it's like a sunshine run. It's like a sun or something goes one way, but it's one way, one of the sun because I'm trying to interpret the world my way now. So the sun shines in some places. So when it shows sign, things get better, You know, 'cause it means you have more capacity and more energy. You have more dates, more to do because the sun lost. But the sun doesn't last forever. Every day, 24 hours a day, what do you do? 24 hours. Sunrises it then goes down. So if you're struggling. So for the dear friend son, the writing son, the BFF writing son item 'cause I'm seriously playing I'm taking back my my my, my persona myself from the best side. So guys, this is about. Safety critical systems, I don't spell it for you, but you know this transmit is rubbish anyway you can transfer to different rubbish. So, So you got a song. It rises on day, night and day, night and day. Or if you don't start anything you say very important if you don't stand this night and day already, if you don't understand anything, understand what I'm doing on this paper. About war stuff, war tech, fighting tech. OK, so the sun rises this moon, the sun becomes a Half Moon. The Half Moon becomes what a a like a moon. It's like a it's like a Croatian. It's like a great croissant. It's like a Hoffman. This is another try like a trimming, trimming, a little trimming. Let me look at the moon. But so we get the moon what you get the sun on the other side. So on the side of the sleep, the moon is the sun, you know. But you know, just because the tires going doesn't mean the moon is not there. So the moon is there definitely definitely just you don't. So the moon swan, the moon is night and day. So this way you understand night and day. So here we have what the sea, only the sea. So here because, you know, give it basically on the land, you know, with different, you know, we're fighting for like the bite of beer for. So this is very important to me to waking up. So this kind of land is there, you know, by the time of day, it's so hard to so it's so like hard to keep track of. Loose truck very quickly because you know once the sunsets you know the good night and day then you go to sleep and you wake up but when you're sick you don't want to wake to sleep. You know you want to stay awake the best possible in cycles. So the sun has 123 that's what you have like 4 days 24 o'clock because you know everything speaking three. I didn't try it anyway so. This is like a what interest is a triangle model, the triangle model. So basically you got another get to see the triangle model, but you don't do it with your eyes, you do with your all the senses. You know the boat's shipping out. You have to know what you're doing. The multiple should get in the day. You know it's not. Basically you want to do the most important thing. In the morning, which is when the moon comes in or the day is the moon is night, moon day. So basically in 12 hours Standard Time is what the default for normal day. But you know, 24 hours Standard Time is multiple. But you know, this is a problem. This is duality, I'm calling it. So basically this man, radical rational. Framework I'm reading around why I'm not getting things done. You know why I'm not doing stuff to how I'm doing stuff. So this might work my ontological revelation. So I love this guy's team because you love this like me. If you don't love it, you know barefoot, you don't stand the sun meaning in the barefoot you don't understand. So, so if you don't love it, you know, then you know, or you have something that doesn't make sense to me, just tell me and I'll try to mix it with the system better for everyone. So this is a 12 hour system, not just to the four hour system. Now in four hours is military time, but it gives you more time, more time, but more time to what in the sea if you're fighting, you know. Fight more time to fight, but don't move them to fight. Why haven't you done it in 12 hour time? You know you haven't done it in 12 hour time. So basically in 12 hours, you know, 12 hours minimum you to like defend the vital breakfast. You know, I love myself, you know. So when the sun then comes, you know, get the the sunrise, the sunrise, so the sunrise. And then the sun goes, obviously the sun, and then you get this one, go this way and then you get this one. And you get half the sun and you get sunset. So sunrise to sundown. So let's go like moonlight. These are the same thing there, you know, the same thing in the day. You know, when is basically one is one song sunset in the sun, barefoot sunrise, you know, you know about the sun rising doesn't seem to get that's what we have a time model there, but you know. Busily 24 hour **** is stupid anyway, there's not basically I'm trying to change the track which is gonna be working there. You know, if you have if you want to, you know, but you know if you're working for for the people in you with us, you know So this 24 hour this is stupid time. Military triumph you know if i was just rubbish i hit it i hit it when i when I talk, I was there per day in Biafra anyway, so we used 12:00 Standard Time. For certain. So now my different constitution, we have 6 hours maximum a day to work now that's what we can work 6 hours a day, which is what it wasn't different Nigeria until I start working 7 hours as a child. But you know you said I had to get to pay my dad. So basically my daughter will be going with me through more work so I could do it. So this six hours. But you know, because you have 5 to 6 hours, you know. Child wants to work, you know they don't need to work so that's allowed like everyone else to smoke 6 hours a day, you know that's half day. Oh sorry, sorry that's wrong. Basically 6 hours a day it's half days. So I booked half day. I didn't want to work half day because by that meeting 7 sorry, they meant what you know allowed only. Have they? So a child is half an adult, a adult. OK, basically I'm thinking of genes right now so I'm giving you guys properly. So a child is half an adult, but that's where I can be man or woman, boy if a man wants, if not boy wants to work more out to come. But a man expects to become a man, so they need to work hours. So basically. Our child was only three to six hours naturally, but you know, I do. I didn't like it in school, but if I want to do something else, six hours is the account six hours of child. So basically I want you to like 3 hours or less. 3 hours unless Why? Why? Because you know. 1/4 of the day of 12 is what, 3 three hours maximum? That's the maximum you're not working. No if no, but as a as as a as a. As a child, so the minimum time the child you know is 3 hours, you know, per day for your family, for your work day, three hours a day. You know, we have to get money, something to get something from it. You know what is money? It's not basically can get money. You can get money from his children. Money for me, but you don't want to get money. I just want to buy some foods. You get basically someone, you get to watch the what you need, what you need, So what what you want. Basically you just type in the model here. So you see what I'm saying? The sun is going to move. There's no difference. You know, you can work in the day, you can work in the night, you know. But you know, you guys are meant to work with the person that you are. You get paid for, you know, I want you just to working on it. We don't want to work. I want to get reviews, you know, this time the whole time. So time is of the essence for you guys, you know, so if you're like. MMM, obviously you have. I don't tell anybody 5 to work. So basically when I start working, I started working at. Age of 5. That's so I don't know what this favors will be doing in the shop, you know so basically I don't want to like tell you guys this, but I don't want you guys. I want you guys to like you know, the children to be working at age 5 'cause you know Peggy system. So you got honestly got honestly 123 is banned from working anyway. The truck is a child turned 5 and 6 and you. You want to work. You know, see, I said yes, yes, you know, and he said Are you sure you want to work 'cause it's not going back if you say yes again, yes guys, that's for the children. But if you say I need to sign them up, so basically you have to see them, confirm them by video, like you know, video 123. Uh, yes, it says 3 yeses. Yes. Why 'cause you know, if you make a mistake, we don't make a mistake once. They call themselves a second time if they make a purchase, but you know, that's for the verbal or, or, or neurodivergent people, you know, and then you go to. So you have to do 3 * 3 times. See some the maximum of 6 times, you see that? No, but you know they see it, but they write it on paper. The document is basically the form just filling 3 forms, 3 forms, independent forms, not even like together guys, these are very fine. You know, if I make it 12 forms, you know better for you guys, you know, let's say 3 to 6 forms. Because as a child you know 3 forms is like so 3 to 9 phones for. Because 3 * 3 three times in a day is they can work 3 * 3 two plus 360. So 6 forms could have to fill in six 6 plus 633 forms. When they say it video audio they heard but they said 3 + 3. But they need three of them to verify people. So you don't want to work minimal hours. You do form send a form and then say it in person. I'll get a audio recording because anybody's sued by a child guys not embarrassing for you guys and they get sex but the maximum allowed to work 6 times and they get to work and do it with them. But they're allowed to work on the half the time. So if. With an adult 6 how do i work so i'll do 6 12 hours a day, basically I'm allowed to work 12 hours a day. You know, I don't want to spend one more hour working my life like, you know, working for who, not who who who I for myself. So 12 hours a day, 6 + 6 is 12. So that's a minimum I'm allowed to work. A lot, but they don't want to work in the So basically I want to get like a six hours work 'cause you know, I try to do 6 hours a day anyway 'cause this is a day, but you know, that's just six hours past. This was birthday 6 * 6 is what, 36 hours a day? So most people going basically, I don't want you to see how the work to do, you know, 'cause I mean system is broken, you know? So there should be no one working sequences. I was just working like a a 6 + 6 out there. 12 hours day maximum, no maximum a day maximum. If you never want to do overnight, that's day cover day and night. You know whatever they were doing that day and night covered two hours. If you're able to walk to the six hours they are, they are crazy. They could something wrong with the system. Who lost the people? So that's kind of intelligent duality. So Charles loved obviously a child, a young woman, a woman basically tried 3 forms. A young woman is what's allowed to work a young girl basically if I'm meant to work 6 hours a day. As a as a child, you can shoot through. I'm not scared of you guys shouldn't because you don't. If you want to work, you don't want to. It's fine. But you know you're going to work with something you want. So six hours is maximum. Now I get 3 hours a day. Uh, questionnaire, Uh, two to six? Umm, how's it it follow? Unless you keep them, them having money in their pockets and money and doing things. So basically this wallet is called Why go to the psycho duality? I want to do something but I don't have to do it. So you can buy assets so they're more interested to access to. They basically audio systems, basically a child can have more assets basically than adults they need. So basically, you know, I don't know what I need. I need money. The money is there, but the money is not there. It's a month to get fit. But you know, that's my food, guys. That's my food. My food is a chocolate. I bought a food, I buy a loaf of bread, a bread. I don't, I don't know, I didn't put the bread. I don't have to buy milk. If I can do more work for milk and I do money milk and then there's something nice. Money food for food, not like rice, jello, fries for the for for the week. So I'm doing a lot to work weekly only Week 2 weekly. So they have two weeks to work or one week off, you know, 2 to 1. So so this is 3 weeks. So basically if they if they ever worked three weeks, they were basically 3:00 to. Work with the right model, but this is very much the street work to shoot right now. And the two to three weeks are to work maximum. So that's the one days so that we have to take the entire next week off, you know, 'cause you know, but then you can do that, that maximum 3 to 1. You don't want to keep it like that. They then work the next week in for like a week, a second, a second, you know, like you know this name working like a Monday. They allowed to if they want to. They look for a day because we care for these children now because it can be very smart a day after the week. That's been one day, 20 + 21 day, 22 days. That means they need that one day back one day back and what we need to do is to give them that break. You know, they're not allowed to work. You guys should be actually stopping them. So my system should block them entirely by daily. So my system allowed them to show to be blocked entirely from entering that environment to work. They don't allow it in there for that time. You know that that's a good something else. You know so it's. Healing people's Italy by making sure this way I don't say I'm busy. I'm running you guys. But I'm not saying I'm running you guys. I'm saying you work for me. I'm not saying you work for me, I'm saying you work for me. No, no, I don't want that. I say do your work, guys. No, I don't like it OK when I say you. Basically when you say I work for you and that means I'm not happy you're control me, I'm a slave. So this is what this one means. You know I'm not free, but work is labor. Labour is tiresome. You become tiresome, but it's not it's about liberty about independence. So only basically this so this thing I went to Lucas system. So what I want to introduce you guys is something that. Oh my time. 03 minutes. MMUKOM for mother, M for Mike. If I'm imagining Anthem, Mike U for Umbrella, K for Kilo and O for Oscar, it's the zygote coherence system. But you know, it's really about pushing all the kids, you know, so you know, civil class civilization. So basically. A civil collapse is what so basically the mucosystem, what obviously mucous children services, you know healthcare, you know basically you want to do themselves. You know you want basically I don't need to be with children, you know, like any adults would be with the children shouldn't go to the shop. They didn't think stop holding the kids hands, guys. Stop putting my hand. I want to say I want a house guys. No, my mom and. Basically this is the MUCO, you know, initiative. So basically this. OK, So what my initial game, the one I will, the children's will go, the zygote will, the zygote will and then we got. Muco mucocycle. Uh, so muco we can go to uh, muco onion, onion. So this is muco onion. And because I got so system, so you got the wheel and we must keep moving, you know, without the adults, without the adults, without the adults with us. I'm holding my hand again. The child duality, Adult to man. Not sure. Hold my hand ever again, you know. We'll it's my universe now and we almost keep moving the roads are broken on broken roads are the worst roads for a child is distressed killing massacre a 1967 war TO1920003000. Present day, 30 years old, 50 years old, an ongoing and still going 'cause it's not really just moving. And then what? Duality. Now rediscovered so basically the children of Red House should rediscover themselves the zygote discovery we they can do spread basically the most brilliant life into them. So basically this zygote quality. So basically should I basically we we have the right to hear, but we should have a worse. So the thing about this basically. To breathe, but it's not an option. It's an option every time was breathe. The mother wants to breathe more. Breathe, you know, it's not. It's a suffering. If there will be an enemy, the dead, if they'll be any child I've seen breathing, it's not sure. OK, you model now. Mr. We're using this this Lego wheel and I got a problem. So basically the model, everything I see there is problematic. So I'm trying to give it to you breathe. Live from worker. OK so this is need. I need to. And this is something called the dynamic scale. So basically it's called a dynamic scale. Need to want, need to want and then. Aspirational foundation to aspirational You know what's your local name? We go more. OK, basically guys, this is like also strip back here. I mean magazine is going to try to get a softer too. So let me try to give you that. So this is the build that so you can see these people that want 2/3. Me 'cause i'm just gonna do my PH D's my PH D's mythological revolution for children even though the mothers or the fathers, you know, 'cause I wanted to be independence, a flush with a man or woman, 'cause, you know, I see women as men, but they are do not have men. They are women that can give life and protect things. But you know they can take them because you put you indirectly. So basically it's more indirect, but what can it be? Direct means you protect everyone directly without saying to someone else. There's empower to do it. So I think my wife who talks to me when she wanna she wanna solve a problem. Once I saw the problem with other wives, you know what she's having a hustle or not. I don't have but I want 2 wives someone 2 wives don't want anything were from the Nigeria 'cause you know that I'm not really necessarily. So basically the breathing is not optional. That's but the breathing problems overlap with what the life problems and the life problems of work problems. So basically breathing, you need air, you need food, you need water. You know, since you survive, turn the knife to life. You need life into it, into your sleep. You need to be waking up cycle and doing work. Now the work is an optional framework. So you're not allowed to work if you don't want to work. You know work is an option. You can work to get some money to see and stuff. But you know that same thing. Do I, I need to see something? This is just the first error. If you see someone say this is the model you, you, you breathe your life and you live your work a **** model. So you get a second model here. This is this is an error prone model here. No. So it's like a So what you need is A1. Do you need it or do you want it or do you this week, If you, if you breathe, you need it. If you breathe in the air to breathe, if you leave, guys, you know you want to live. You, you want you know you want to live. You know you don't wanna die. Believing doesn't mean your life, you know, saying if you're alive, you're living already, but you're not surviving. So you can want to die, you want to live. So you can say I don't want to live, you want to suicide, you know, but if you work, you want to work. We don't want to work, you know, you want to live, you know, I'm saying, so you don't want to work, you want to, you want to work. No, that's the quality there, so. This is come from so basically living does not mean your life I love doesn't mean you're living and working does not mean you want it. You know, you know, you walk into something, you know that's the objective there. So that's duality problem. So that's one inspiration every day, the ******* UK and that's what means that I'm broken. And so I want something. I need a house. End of physical health care 2014. Until four years old, my date of birth is 19th of May 2001 Namdi just out of 30 care. I'm going back to Nigeria guys. But you know, if I say I want someone to console you don't want it, you need it. You need it. You don't need it. You want it. I don't want it. I need it You know you know I want a free house under healthcare 14 days you come to to get you get. I didn't accept that the longest time. I'm gonna take the 518-2525. My life independently yes that's obviously basically just duality. So you've got the code word should, should, should. I should not listen to you. If I, if I could use something that means definitely a foundation, you know, I could do it. But, you know, I'm thinking about not doing it 'cause it's gonna give me stress in my mind, my business. I get fatigued, you know, Sir. But if it gets bad, so bad, I don't. And I want it. And I should do it and I'm living really, if I'm living I and I and I then I need to want something. I want something and I can't get it. I continue living where I am, you know, cycle of oppression, depression, and then I leave it. But you know, I wasn't doing that. I was like trying to get the best of my time. So this kind of model in my head, so. Live a want and. Uh, but so if I, if I want to live, I then would do it. So I would eat, you know, for the next day, 'cause I get hungry, get angry, get sad, you know, I know I still don't mind. And if I work, if I work, I want to, I would work. I want to work, but I don't want to work, guys. I want to live. But you know, I'm confused with living and working. Now, because I don't know that I need to breathe to live, to work first before I can stop easily, I'm not even gonna work for anyone anymore in my life. I don't give a **** again, I'm getting, I'm getting a £330 million in my bank account. So you can't do cancel and that's good enough for me. I'm not for my entire life constitution I'm not. I'm not like them, so basically never be like them If I get you know, for them, I don't really care about them really dying. But but I am real. I know my mom too. So I want to work. I would do it so I can expire and do my things I want to do So I must work. You know, I must work to get my separation goals done. This I want to do my life done. My going to came. Doesn't go to, you know, two years. Basically you get to grant 31,000. Basically the by by by the theme I'm saying to guys, I'm giving that's the the model now and you want to put another video 'cause you know, oh, the video. What time do you want to see? I'm going to try to do so. This is the other one here, but this is like a problem. So this is that good problem. This I have other all the if I'm perfect will. My nature I'm PhD, why aren't I getting the perfect support? The first I could do everything myself, you know, if I am the perfect, the best of the best, which I know I am the best of the best, which you know, that's exactly from now. So that's, that's exactly good problem. Duality of the system. And you, you reflection me to you guys. 30 money basically I'm giving you guys double the friends in my mind 'cause my intelligence work at the UK this time documents are like to go research. What else have I got now? 3 to 1 Mapping 2. OK, so there's a different son, so let's get a son a model again so I can see you guys are here doing something to do it properly. So this one's up. Basically if you make an error here to a child, this is the model you get to be the one. If you bring this one guys, it's a dangerous. So this is inverted, this inverted to something else. So this is 1 here is 333. This you got three years, you got three, you got three. Basically you got a 3A and 3B. But they continue to be there. They want so homogeneous and more spectral. And this is like a model SO1 you're breathing, you're living, you're working children automatically if anybody touches, you want to start from 3B and go to UA. So you can put it by physician by law, by law, but and by constitutional. On rights policy enforcement, you know everyone will see it's myself. You're stupid child, because of stupid people. You know you're watching a movie and somewhere else in the world, I don't give a ****. But you know where, when I live happily, you know, if I never see anybody with my on social media due to my show, anyone in my position, anyone's children in my position, I swear to God, now sue them and put down their money. You get direct to see them too. You know no 'cause you know I'm not joking with many people there. This has to stop. You know the cool wood should duality, but you know it's a must. It's a must. So this one has to break it. You could just literally start 3 beats aspiration. You can kill aspiration. What you want to do first, you know you know say oh you can't do that you know just. She said, oh, I know you can't do that. She sued him. You see them? Basically you have to say, OK, I know my rights, don't worry about it, I'm gonna sue you online. You got things like Mone claim.org. What? You. Com the original on social media basically on the Internet just take that video, put it on the muco or media platform and you get the money from the background. Basically this money came many claim.gov.uk. Or Monaco, Universal, you know, for the UK one for the 1NG1, for the Ng. So this was about the children, the Ng, the children. Children go move up. They keep moving up, they keep going. You know, no matter how old they are, we are still our children. Their children shouldn't necessarily. It doesn't matter how old I am. But you know, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I've just broken off my second operation and not my mom, you know, in English before I, I've, I've changed, I've achieved my, I didn't need to change this change. So I'm, I'm making my change where I want to live. So I'm changing what system already is. So it's my own city that you guys are going to live there. Free of charge can go your friend's house. You know, you know issues of you know you have to have your own space, your own cats and dogs, you know, especially when you turn. UH-6 or 7, so 6 or 7. Wait, when you start working children listening about children, obviously you just work start working so, so it's also not 5 because don't know last week. Just look forward because we've worked 6:00 or 7:00, but you know you don't get. Obviously you never get, you don't get to be funny video and you're 6 year old. As a policy, you're not allowed to work for me 'cause I I don't give the job. But you know, if you find someone that's working at 7, you turn 7, seven years old, you turn 7 years old. You know, then you can say, oh, my friend was six years old, want to work, but he's 6 and I'm seven. So you can work with your friend, you know, you have to be on the phone at 7, you know? System 3 to 7, so 7 years is the policy started work, but you know, it's 1616 or seven, it started work with that person. You know, it's basically there's some kind of, you know, I don't want to make it so which is a group of three, three children, so 7. So you can be 1 seven-year old and two what, 6 years old. And you can work to 15 so you turn 15 and 1615 minimum. So the minimum you are the maximum is 7 years old. You're allowing us and the 01 duality and then the 14 to busy has to be. 15 years uh, UH-14 basically I only got to. Biddy 15 years but he go 14 for 14 to 15 years old. Uh uh, you guys are I don't want you to sell it from there. So let's try this first guess for now, guys. Uh, I want you guys to be 15 and 16 to work to have like arrest weapons and my freedom. Basically everything is free. So you like, you know, if you live in a so it's a bit I'm thinking of so 14 I went to Cambridge 15I. To do you an army, so this is the army of 15, but since 16 years old so basically at 15 years old, 15 is the minimum you're allowed to work on 14 guys 15 to stop working at insurance section. So your structure basically stops your child as long as you start getting a total of like survival and stuff like that finding about. War everything is fine that you know it's fine because you know that's how the world is. You know the world is very noisy, so the noise has to be confused to you. So you could join army 15 years old, like I want to do the British Army by my situation. So 15 years or 16 years old, you're meant to be in the army, but you know, conscripted you are you are like you know you are not conscious until. 16 years old, you know, you know he's 15 years old. So basically you are. It's not an army in plus in three years platinum platinum, you know, you see in the platinum already like a three person friends. They got to go to 6 platinum taking a smallest Army unit. And then that, you know, that could be Muka TV, Muka TV, that kind of reporting, news reporting, I can go 3 * 3. Is a A6. So basically this is an example I'm giving you now. So if you join the micro TV micro media, you're going to be in the army. But you know you get the muco Lego dragon between the Lego army. So the children's army, the zygote dragon, they protect the children the the the history. So zygote children. A child you know but your child is not an an adult so we are teenagers child teenagers look at the teen Google teens muka teens. You know you guys are very good. So teens are meant to really give so busy the teens him to go to muco or zygote teens dragon because you know I don't give you my right give Dragons are what they breathe fire, but you know they. Fine, literally in the opposite direction, in the enemy's direction. And then you got the Mukuma, that Dragon's Max courage, the the masquerade. Masquerade. Not like people like small people who keep quiet. So basically can be fired and keep quiet by fire. You know, I don't want to be fire. And then you can like masquerade. Oh, I I know something about this. I can be fine. Being can't be fine. We don't know. But you know, I don't show you all my intentions yet. You know, people that don't want to expose anything. But I don't give anything NDA yet because you're not. If I should breathe muscular, what breathe masquerade and what and? No, basically anka Sir Mukul Dragons masquerade. Uh, unsolved? Is it my soul? No, no, no, no, no. Avatar. Am I the Avatar? Why? Basically your personal development framework is an avatar. So my avatar is the masquerade itself. You know, like the spirit match with the, the, the dancing express, you know, especially don't know what your aura is. You're like a private, as I said, you know, you're high-ranking or you're low ranking, but we don't know. And then we got breathing, mosquito breathing and what the last one I did Muco breathing Muko dragon. Basically you got the the the turtles and the dragon. Because basically a signal is listening. You go to turtle, you turtle watch can go somewhere and stay there for a long, long time, you know, and live there and grow with churches. Other questions, That's a Muko tattoo. So you got a dragonfly. So dragon can fly very fast, but it's also can go very slowly. So this is taking goals, but not as fast as dragon. So that's all this is just going to be very slow, very small movements. It just makes and you get the job done. It gets the job done. Can be very smart. Is it going to be the dragon? So the total is like, you know, land security, stability and rebuilding stuff, you know, if you can build stuff and then you get a turtle moving slowly if you do all of that, you know, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. Oh yes, I get it now. And I'll try to build, build, build, build double to make sure I've got everything called human so. Signal model. So signal to noise. Signal noise. Usually I get a signal. Signal to what? Build something, I do my time to my time to build it properly. So four years of my life, 24 years condition and then we get turtle. So the turtle is a rock. It's like a hot shell, you know, shell everything has to compensate how much I'm basically talking about my framework. So you go to talk to avatar. The turtle can leave. This is the first thing to basically you go to turtle on the move that stability with the people and you go to turtle media Muko turtle. So basically the Muko turtle is like, you know, if you go to in city. Difficult to this repository here. Uh no uh this li qi often even fill the image now, but you know, let me find an image now. Basically this is a this is an image of a turtle in urban access SNSIGII. There's an image there because the total is an Amazon yes, it's in there so you can be. Can pick one to give me one to two one by policy you have to do be 1 total rank and the dragon rank. You know at least one if you would 232 to one touch is got 5. But you know you can mix it up. Can you go from 2 turtles 131 one dragon to two turtles and or two dragon to 1 turtle? He has to be there for me. Very good to mix up this model and mix data and types and then we get. More people now. So that's the test of fly. Think about it now. You speak to the people, now I have to get a right to speak to someone. You're going to drop. OK, so basically there's an image of a turtles there, but you know, protocol survival. Oh, no. Oh, it's not coming out people. Oh, no. Total has move club means the spirit of evil turtles is what the turtle is what the turtle is slow. So it's not slow. It's basically subjective bound only. So the total is slow, but it's slow on purpose. It gets to the goal, it gets the job done, which is just working on proof or something to work on it, and it's slow. It gets approved down and it has stability. Oh chuckles goes to policing as soon as what? Stability is good as work done work done. That's a tier 3A. So chair 3A sponsor turtle, and chair 3B is the turtle in the robot having a system? The chair three beam is basically the chair 3A is open Open Access. A three eight and a means what A means what if. Authentic avatar you know and be for beer, you know 33 big Obi Nexus beer. That's a beautiful, I believe what because I want you to do now 'cause you know, if I don't treat it now, I I didn't want to change it. I want to change because, you know, it wasn't working for me. So that's what I'm saying. So beer and fry come and take. So the three 3 is this is the hot chair, the Obi chairs OB hot or hot? Also take take come and take a beer friend. If you want to be part of the to go to 38 and you know, basically a dual model, you know, that's three days can go from easily. I'm trying to like bridge the path because, you know, book the path if I get just mixed, if I ever make it a biological model, like, you know. If tier 3, it can go to tier 3B, but it's tier 3. There's a lot of requirements to get to Chapter 3 A to Chapter 3 B because you don't want to keep it like this. This one should be for security, but you can make it 3 ABC. You know, someone can go into anyone and gets it anything they need. So 'cause they have a path to work basically. There's no, there's only going to go back and forth basically. You can go up or down. So that's the idea. So there's no weird access model. So up, down XY access, and basically this is my XY access and this is 3 axis. Then can go from here and get a part to go to the branches to two passes and get anything they need. This is correct. This is the description model. It's corrupting the system. Basically, the two not meant to not respect me, but respect what was there already, you know, in their source. But, you know, I'm thinking of taking like some kind of going to my land 'cause I didn't have a Kingdom, I have to have land a lot in there. I have to get all my data from them and, you know, go and build my land, get my allotment to build my PhD. Start my pH D now a superior concern between that idea. So again, to sum up, children allowed to go all the way to tier 3A, tier 3, but you know, Teddy A, it's a, you know, basically a part of tier 3B already 'cause there's a dragon B dragon nuke. A dragon. That beat fire and dragon that left This is the living is not optional Living is just that, but the work is what options they can work on dragon. But you know what is 1 dragon only for them as a prior to one dragon only as a child only as a child. You know nose can prove they can't go to dragon them. So that's a policy now. So if anybody proves it not gonna get 2 Dragons. Minimum minimum of two drug is required for an adult to be if you want to breathe Dragons, the final drug of the breeding teeth, the living tear and the work or the working tier. But the big two one, that's the Dragons 123. 2-3 uh, live work and then uh. 2323 maximum can be busy. I can be all Dragons. I cannot be all Dragons in my framework there's no you have to be either Uche and then you can be dragon. You can get an MMUK. Mukul chattels. A lot of turtles are like a Ninja Turtles.
