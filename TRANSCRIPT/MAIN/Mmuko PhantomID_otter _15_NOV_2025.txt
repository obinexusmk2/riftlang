Unknown Speaker  0:07  
Oh, my.

Unknown Speaker  0:10  
Try recording audacity too.

Unknown Speaker  0:12  
Okay, can you do for 30 minutes until this cuts off? Okay, guys, so basically, open adity right now.

Unknown Speaker  0:21  
Thank you.

Unknown Speaker  0:32  
On this system here, this

Unknown Speaker  0:36  
video is on Muco phantom ID. Basically phantom ID is very important to understand phantom ID ecosystems, the spirits that have good and evil that connects possible, you know, which is good gaming, Avatar systems, you know, useful, authentic, digital,

Unknown Speaker  0:59  
magic words, impossible. You know, all of this is like, really give guys the option to buy you know, engineer doesn't matter the platform. It's this polygraphic system any language. You know,

Unknown Speaker  1:12  
this thing is very important to me. So about phantom ID? Okay, now, what is a phantom ID? Very important. This is a phantom ID. Now, a phantom ID is a zero knowledge proof system, but it's based on really cutting off the process to

Unknown Speaker  1:28  
both shares. You know, there's no hierarchy or anything.

Unknown Speaker  1:32  
For example, a phantom ID, zero knowledge proof ID based on Node Zero or Python zero, but there's like zero call interface for gaming instructions, real world interaction. And what you know, digital world@github.com

Unknown Speaker  1:49  
ID, it's a it's really a

Unknown Speaker  1:53  
by dive interpreter. For example, you have like a photon process model. So the model of this structure it's like they have like a node as a job, peer to peer to peer by

Unknown Speaker  2:06  
direct resolution. You know how good example is this? So you got this image here, you can look at here, I'm not talking to you see, like this one here, this like one here, they got like a square, square x and a square x, you know those are like, basically, you are the center node, you are the interface, you are the square circle. But you can make a decision. You are the triangle circle. You can make a square decision or exit, just a distinction. I can do otherwise. The other way to make like, but these two represents like two decisions.

Unknown Speaker  2:44  
Can go one way, go the other way, and you can get better the game. You can get outside the game. That's idea, two to one mapping for public key and private key. Now the public key is square. It does one job and experts, but if you share jobs, bro, you know to stop you going backwards in the game. You know, the goal of this is the equitable support assistance in a, you know, fairness of the game, how you want to play a video game, is really a wish.

Unknown Speaker  3:11  
You can go to github.com ID is

Unknown Speaker  3:14  
really an ID system for, like, basically the Fanta, which is like, the mapping between the functions and the separation of concept, all functors are separated from the data. So you go back in the data file, you gotta take into the functor file, you know, but that's a dynamic library for the public system. So it's consume the functions and consume all the functors using a functor framework, which is define order how to use all functions. They are authorized in this model that can feel basically the functions are the functions or library function, or the so library, the shared update library with the data that it's like the data file, code, data file in the C standard is code.so shared a better archive, or that is a library. So it can be a static library set a share of the boundary of the world or or the unique system for the data equivalent, is that that so these DACs and data files work together to give you data and ensure that you are getting progressing throughout the game.

Unknown Speaker  4:12  
It's about the worst case scenario. You know, you never have a constant.

Unknown Speaker  4:16  
How do I play a game? You know, you are going to try, to try this interface, basically in this model as a Polish. You never have, like a dull moment the game, you know, you don't have any dormant in the game. So basically you have, like a system where you have just one mapping. So if I go to game, you have become controller. I think, Oh, I press this button, something should happen, you know. And if the game, if I keep pressing machine button, something else should happen, you know, until the game does crash. No, like something feels it feels like this, like it fails nicely, you know, nice way. You know, it's not like in a bad way. It's like having some kind of a error crushing code, like looking at this system, but we need to fail, you know, we're just gonna report the error field. You don't you found a bug, you know, the game, but that's kind of a thing on a push up from a console. You know? An engine, okay, any system that is based on dynamic library. Systems, DLL so windows and die,

Unknown Speaker  5:08  
lips in Apple interfaces. Systems, you know, that's remote RPE,

Unknown Speaker  5:17  
functional systems, you know, the fourth torrent, like, you know, good of this phantom ID is, like, you quit the session. This is like a game. You have, like, a like, you know. So basically, you are another network. You have a talks or objective. You can be more than others. You can actually go for the square function. I can go for the x, but I can go other way if I finish more my style on this upward direction and go one direction, x square. I pick a lane to progress. How I want, you know, how would I lose the game? But I guided to get better at the game, because the server TCP with gaming. You know, gaming basically got the error correction modeling layers. So basically, Georgia,

Unknown Speaker  6:02  
three Four is FIFA games.

Unknown Speaker  6:06  
78 is like Skylanders.

Unknown Speaker  6:09  
2013 is like,

Unknown Speaker  6:13  
well, so like, like, like, what's that game? Robin? Robin. Robin. Games like, you know. And 15 to 16 is like teenagers, right there, and all of those things and some horror games like you know, becoming us, you know. And then the 17 to 18 is like adults, you know. So basically what I did,

Unknown Speaker  6:42  
so I have a character called tanbra Siobhan. Now, Siobhan is a black character. She's the African character, but she's a female. So if I'm three years old, I'm meant to see Siobhan as a woman, a beautiful man, as you see authentically. You know, I grow a bit older, I see her more authentically as she is, she's she's herself, you know, financial lens, you know. You know, as a child, this guy should never die. Now, Siobhan has me got a thunder dress, you know. So I pick Siobhan as a child. I learned about Sioux story. I see what I see. I follow my partner, Siobhan. I grow older, I learn more about Siobhan. Now, Siobhan has a thunder dress. Now, that thunder dress is like a biome dress. She's, you know, it's like she she has a biome she's in, but that bio is like being broken down by the weather everything. The Scorpion bio, she has a rebellion called a thunder rebellion, which tries to keep the she's

Unknown Speaker  7:33  
not getting much lucky. So she comes either she's good, because she goes, you know, she goes, she's good, but she does evil, you know, because she knows she starts to keep her line that she's in a situation she's just like, more in tune tundra, and then the tundra or she's like a tiny character kinda feels a story on the background is like a flare, her aura, her style, her

Unknown Speaker  7:55  
change how she, how She how she understands reality from her objective, like a persona or development as a protocol. Who is how you want to see sivania. And I can pick Siobhan. I can dress it up when I'm Siobhan,

Unknown Speaker  8:12  
I have to beat people, half of them ideas handle this. Basically the onion system is like a Peggy system. The thing about you got a Peggy to eating anything. Eating plus is M for Mature or go.

Unknown Speaker  8:29  
But you know, it's not the same thing, like plus three plus seven. People don't know that. I'm telling you guys. So basically the module system. So basically Peggy only does plus 18, something 18, which is good, you know, it's you an adult anyway, but anything extreme or very interactive, you know, it's 18 plus, but 18 plus needs more. So that m plus, you don't m plus waiting. I don't really know when I found that, but, you know, those things are like, really more crazy people, but you know, recently snow, basically, 1819, 2121 is n plus 122, 22 plus another, 456789456784,

Unknown Speaker  9:21  
more, 22 two to three to four to five, just using the standard page ratio.

Unknown Speaker  9:28  
But down here, now the system was serious stuff, you know. Okay, so basically, the thing was about MOOC engine ID the center.

Unknown Speaker  9:36  
Every time you start funding session, you had the players. They make the sessions. And you know, it's actually from everyone else, you know, it's an, actually a layer of the local interface. But, you know, the session has started. You don't need anybody else talking to it, you know, until the game ends, it closes and it gives the hand control, like, you know, if I start a game, if I start a game, you know, I don't my game to be interrupted, you know. So I'm live. I'm playing my game, I don't want to be trouble speaking. That's my ID. It's like, you know, I can become a player in the game the community, you know, and such, you know, I saw my game. I pick up front, right? She pick, I pick chef on thunder, Chef, everything on my IoT states my persona. That's my Iota station, my set stage, my my setting that says default, you know, it can be a preset, which is different presets to be my own Iota, and that'll be what's loaded into game. Because my game is my means Chevron.

Unknown Speaker  10:31  
Chevron has some flat I just picked my game, and the game knows me. So then I just pick and I can win the game, you know, more easily, some other learning menu, I mean properties remote. You know, there's no interface to compete anything. There's no There's no competition whatsoever. Because, you know, this is the real world. And if I use the game, I'm using a bet, I should never play the game. I see my chances, everything based on the match making I'm making on the real life system. So it's like a real world. Now, very important, guys. So basically, the thing I'm saying is phantom ID is called phantom ID because you are the Phantom, you know in the network, you know you are the North. Don't know who you are, Spain, Portugal. It doesn't matter Netherlands, UK, US doesn't matter Russia, doesn't matter where you're from, Korea, North Korea. But you have a education resource for that Phantom, if you can trace your fandom, if you want to lie on fuel network of Phantom, you know, your authentic avatar, you know. But you know, kind of bridges that sort of a fan fiction, you know. And the thing is that you protect the children, and actually the child

Unknown Speaker  11:41  
three by solution. So basically, there should be no payments, you know, if you want to play video game for the first time, you try it out, you demo it, you don't, you don't pay no money for it. It's like, you know, once you pay money, you can't put it back, you know, you have to, you try and use it or equity select, you know, put it back. So basically, I'm saying to you, nuclear juice, you know, I don't want anybody paying one pound any money for a game, you know. I want you to see the price system. So basically, you buy something, you buy like an artifact, you sell it, you sell people. You buy all these things you need to sell it. You know, you're looking at based on the system. You're gonna have a house over there. So basically, the incredible ecosystem, you know, buy owns, buy on own, borrow or sell. You know, you know, statistically after you know, just business in bed. So like, you know the circle is the online ID, the MOOC ID, the transition. You play to win. You play to win. You know you don't pay to win, you play to win, you see, but you know, the game has to go on real contribution. You can either cash out in real world or more digital currency. But the thing is, you anything you find into the robot has to come out somewhere or other, you know, because, you know, this week, some kind of balance business equity. So basically, if I pay for a game, I'm paying for something I'm going to use. I'm not paying for something I'm going to discard layout. So the credit system

Unknown Speaker  13:01  
is, if I don't like the game, I can put it down, but it cost me credit, you know, because, you know, I pay for that service, but they use it that kind of business. If I'm not using it, there's no point of me. I should be mistake I made. So use the series of the game, the franchise, you know, the balance of the ledger system. Ledger system as a sparse matrix, imbalance to worse balance, basically the worst balance to the balance, the worst imbalance to the worst balance, the best imbalance, worst case mapping. So basically we play in an ecosystem. You are equitable share. If I want to kill a character and game, I'm very unlock a

Unknown Speaker  13:47  
combo for and I use it. I just use a combo. I just all know the bottom up. And I love to think about it, because you know the game. No, I know enough about my game my character to continue playing with Sharon and wearing a thunder dresses, Thunder gown and I thunder wedding ring. You know this better, feminine by nature, you know, and a scream of thunder to show she's that really, she's a fiction of the park. You know, she's a victim. You know, she's like, she's modeled over an animal with, like, the Vixen, Wolf, like, you know, she's like a woman, but she's an African lion, a woman. But her balance is broken down and she's not allowed. She's like a woman. She's a persona development teacher, character and bubble embodiment of the hierarchy of the survival ecosystem and how she transitions.

Unknown Speaker  14:35  
Everything really represents me is my character. I made this up I'm currently building. You

Unknown Speaker  14:41  
know, she is like, the snow, very small. You know, she's meant to grow in Persona, grow the stolen, grow with the people. So Chevron Siobhan thunder, or what's her name, Siobhan is not shaving. Siobhan thunder dress has a new set, most of both for the place vs LTS, experimental, stable or to

Unknown Speaker  15:02  
stable legacy mappings via the compliance of the Russia dag with the LTS mapping. Minor mutual factor. This is about this little bit dull moment in the game. If I'm learning to play the game, I should be able to keep the game I'm playing without getting bogged down by what I'm doing, you know, the online gaming ecosystem. So basically, Siobhan will be like a character in my game, but I treat her as her own sovereign entity. You know, you know she, she has her own avatar, own emotions. You know, she is real, you know, and can use, obviously, when I'm fighting a protocol, I have to, like, ensure that I can have, like a voice ID system. So basically, SP is, like a SP, like a special point this I get for compressing some something I really want to achieve experience. And the game points, GP, GP or CP, credit points, you know, stand on my own, you know, like you know, no game points, credit points when I started other people, do you know, but I need to do them, if I you know, as a bare minimum, to achieve further further. Do that way. Do My Own documentation, everything. So basically, every time I have a game, I try to formalize it, you know, that's kind of what that kind of thing I want, kind of competition I want, you know, for children in this modern world, I wanted to follow that they are the characters, you know, I want to be taken up. So for me, the basically, if I want to chat, if I want to chat, then the system is, sure, but be, be annoying. So stop swearing on me. I don't really care. I can't hear you, but I saw the selfie said, you know, you can't take that off. But you know, if I'm speaking to someone and I'm trying to beat them up, I can stress talk to them everything. It's very insulted, yes, but you know, I prefer the game.

Unknown Speaker  16:59  
You know, it's some way the system here, as you can see, Bassett, they can put the star bathroom, which is very good, but you show it's understandable, you know. So you can intercept it on your way. So, you know, for me, it's like representing the kind of dilemmas I can have sivan's voice, that's my voice prompt, you know, I can have like, a smack, smack sound like, you know, over again. I am the character. I am the one. So some really, this is my voice. I relate to system and voice, genius, Polygon voice moderator that

Unknown Speaker  17:35  
gives me her voice in the game, you know, Batman, the Batman speaks

Unknown Speaker  17:42  
Batman. I speak as my voice, and the voice monitors the Batman or, like, you know, I then I press the button. I press the combo, three, three system, like, you know, I press a combo. It's online system. And the system makes your tongue thick, you know, gives me some kind of way to change it to the straight way. Or something like, you know, something more aligned with my dresser. Like, so

Unknown Speaker  18:04  
much change, you know, but it's like ensuring that that thing is more natural to me.

Unknown Speaker  18:13  
An avatar is using avatar. Basically, it's debit system, but the debit is for you, you know, to ensure that the game is aligned with your organization. Because, I don't know about the buying game from me, I like three things, but the game is there because, you know, you have to pay for the game to try unless you really want to get better. You pay for stuff in the game. You get it. You don't need to pay for the old game. So

Unknown Speaker  18:37  
basically, it's about alternative journey and real world experience and ensuring that the avatar can grow. You know you have to feed your characters everything. Just feed yourself. You know you don't feel the characters feed yourself. So you go like that. You got like the photo model, square zero or before, which is like a number four, universal one, between the mappings of Xbox and PSO. Number x, square one is one. Number triangle two, two a two is one, A, 2y is one. No such triangle two one. Number two is like, you know, 123, 4x or square is one. Triangle to y is to x3 and, you know, just like a button, you know, controller. But you can do, like the minimum one of these, but the standard one is the game. Have some way to tackle the interface already in there. So we can show, like, a full compliance with the cycle the buy that interpretation layout for active credit systems, you know, try buy this system. Just have this money to buy this, and what I need. So, gonna buy this? I said, wanna buy this game, you know, like, you know, there's no real money involved. It's just like credit for currency, you know. Because, you know, the problem with the real money is, if you put it in, you don't, you can't get out and call it. So please put more money in, you know. Just wanna see what the gaming, game over and over again is the same result,

Unknown Speaker  20:04  
garbage. So that's the thing.

Unknown Speaker  20:07  
It's just like, it's like, you know, but I don't see that, you know, it's better if it becomes more personalized. You know, there's some degree of authentic appeals to someone. It appears to sell our people, you know, you know this group, but that's appease them. Just appeal to them, you know, in the first way, so you can equity it. You know, you don't appease everyone there when you're gonna read your whole story, ruin everything. It appealed to the group that need a fan fiction. But see how the character was hoping. To see how authentic the black African history is like me, which is why

Unknown Speaker  20:45  
for this woman, that Igbo woman, is fighting him to visit my coach, my woman, how beautiful she is. Everything, basically the Phantom ID, the voice mutilation program, other things, what are things you can do, the authentic input validator, like, you know, cristifying game, things that show that, you know, I am playing as authentic as possible, representing that character. They switch my voice, come knock him quiet and speak Turkish is your work in an angry voice, you know. But you know, the goal is to really say ABC like, you know, it wasn't gonna say, say Siobhan, like, you know, but I'm speaking of voice time, and then it's really like messages to me, no time get a game interface guy I can see what I'm saying to, you know, if he comes up, you don't usually say that. You know, just what he needs to do doesn't need to be so in one but you know, the randomness, the personal development, integrity of the functors, the model of the Genji voice, you know? So basically I'm saying I can have one to one voice for children, or depending on the mood. I am happy, sad, angry. Last you know, so there's some kind of angry,

Unknown Speaker  22:08  
sighted, something that's bad direction. I can weigh my skill for authentic expression in that framework. For example, I kept so happy and cry because I was so beautiful. That's called a okpa Moron. But that seems offensive. At the same time, they feel happy and sad at the same time. I Because, you know, this beautiful, you know, that's I'm saying, give people authentic, you know, I don't want to give anything like this budget to give you a cycle of this rumor dynamics for myself, you have

Unknown Speaker  22:40  
phonological so basically, you don't pay attention. Play demo of the game I'm building. I'm not being a game. So giving you the other the Muco

Unknown Speaker  22:48  
ID, Muco, which means the Spirit, committing people as a slogan

Unknown Speaker  22:56  
and and we rule and you know, so we can ensure that you know things like snagging everything you know, turn the screen. She's gonna have a buy in the future. She's gonna have visions, you know, for the future her daughter, but you know, she can navigate that.

Unknown Speaker  23:12  
Good of this is to ensure that zero knowledge proof system things that are

Unknown Speaker  23:20  
not hierarchical, because one I have is like a hierarchy based phantom ID card number is not meant to relay the information in the hierarchical manner. You know, the system closes over. You can never get a bit session. You know, there's no the game will not continue. You know, because they leave that's honestly to pick up. So basically the model is like starring star square. This is a square. This circle in one is like the switchable one. I can take of control. That's, I think I really I can come to numerator, but the x and square systems, so they just swap out the moderators. That means someone else is doing the moderator on the moderator on the computer, and, you know, the game goes like, you know, you know, what is the video game, or an online game on a slow working the game is there and the system is coherent. There's no, there's no, there's no electric system validation the blockchain, you know, based on the function system that is passed, have a boss that should be sparse enough to with the ledger involved.

Unknown Speaker  24:31  
You can share static, economic products on the internet.

Unknown Speaker  24:45  
Connection, you just play locally. If you want to go to localize and dominate 1200

Unknown Speaker  24:59  
milliseconds in two screens. If you cut that down to one second, that would be 60,000,060

Unknown Speaker  25:07  
milliseconds per two frames. But then that means you have to separate that into one frame, making sure you squeeze all the frame of animation into one so basically 220,000 frames, or maybe between 60 frames, one ratio, and you can have that between the UI player so that 30 frames each as equity, that'd be 4443, and four is very important for you to understand you cannot work.

Unknown Speaker  25:38  
Yes. So basically, you cannot work because the famous kind of ecosystems understands, identifies, and again, can adapt in real time to fix any errors as FORTRAN from the models.

Unknown Speaker  25:54  
So what a nuclear ID usually is a console.

Unknown Speaker  26:00  
For me, I'm thinking consoles, the people are gaming, working different ways nowadays. We have to ensure that they are. There's an equity between how much you play, how much to work. You know, when you consider player work the same thing. It's not the same thing to me. You know, when you're making money, you're actually doing something, you're working. You know, when you know, when you are not messing around, you're just

Unknown Speaker  26:22  
playing with it.

Unknown Speaker  26:24  
And how you especially get one thing over the other it takes, how, how, like, how, you know, with your life, acting something. So that's the active modeling. So how am I gonna act on this situation, with this craft, with this limitation, with this reward, I'm getting an aim for what? You know, what I'm gonna get? Another gonna have hardest combo rate succession session. So that's a GitHub accomplish ID, which I can Muco ID for.

Unknown Speaker  26:52  
Goal is I have a Muco ID framework,

Unknown Speaker  26:56  
instructions, everything that's authentic and communicate and real world blockchain validity over four times, bi directional dagger systems as interpreters for regional rotation.

Unknown Speaker  27:11  
Thank you very much. My name is Nnamdi. Please check out the virtual reality github.com, O, B, I, N, E, X, U, S, slash, F, M, U, K, O, i, d,

Unknown Speaker  27:26  
guys, the future of gaming is now. The future is now.

Unknown Speaker  27:30  
Thank you very much for watching that is a nuclear ID. Muco, socials, media, political engines.

Unknown Speaker  27:42  
Muco, sweet

Unknown Speaker  27:46  
things that express small

Unknown Speaker  27:54  
identity.

Unknown Speaker  27:56  
Thank you very much, and please like and share this video if you're interested on the system is good on youtube.com/ob, I neck is playlist at open space, slash playlist, or the playlist, or you can see the More link and go To the GitHub. Another message. Thank you very much. You
