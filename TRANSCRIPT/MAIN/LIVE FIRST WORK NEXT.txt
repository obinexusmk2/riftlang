OBINexus Update on 11-10-2025 Constution You LIVE ADN WORKTHERE


Okay. Okay. Nami. Namdi. Very important. Okay. Um, this is okay. Okay. Or seal
0:06
introduction. What is an oral seal? Okay. Lack of control, not control.
0:12
Okay. Very important. Okay. This is not a quantum computer introduction, but my masters in HD uh hybrid instruction
0:18
systems uh for from Cambridge is being delayed. It's just one stop from London
0:24
because I'm leaving London or London area or Greater London or central London uh because I'm going to Cambridge
0:30
because solely because um the council is not giving me a house but I'm going to
0:35
still find a way to Cambridge tomorrow. Nambdi after um no Monday I have to call it. Okay NDI are you talking to yourself
0:42
ADHD I have to purchase and learn ability. So they say I know myistic and ADHD and dyslexia because they make me
0:48
dyslexic but don't have for my mouth so I'm not that severe unless I want to get angry so but I don't do it on purpose
0:54
sometimes I just to be very careful why I see online because this international law can make his terrorism I won't give
1:01
a 300 million pound claim uh remember 240 million uh times new no yes times
1:08
new times ream council uh times K council times uh 300 million
1:15
making it uh plus 700 million in value added tax very important 700 because now making 1,4200 billion uh and then they
1:22
will not lose their house lose their business and I can go to the third council because they're making my life difficult just for the leave white paper
1:30
uh first notes notes very important this one okay so remember you got have a structure to your day as well very important you got to go to Cambridge
1:36
whether you like it or not um I think I'm being delayed this year so next year going be 1,000 uh per masters and PhD
1:43
making it a total of £82,000. Uh remember your uh PhD is really ontological basian infrastructure
1:49
intelligence infrastructure uh AI systems for smart homes. Remember your
1:54
because this your cause your GenZ you're building new foundations for your masters and PhD uh 15th September to 1st
2:01
October uh is uh your deadline for clearing you missed it uh but you may
2:06
not be rich for getting it this year uh date today is 11 10 2025 again 11 10
2:12
2025 uh so the October uh today is Saturday okay very important let's
2:17
continue so you're going to go to Cambridge anyway but you know you have to be housed in Cambridge for another year if not applicable because you want
2:23
to move out the UK cuz they don't there's no houses and they're going to cry everything. I don't care, you know, and people going to follow me to
2:29
Cambridge. I don't care cuz I'm I'm a rebel. Okay. So, basically today is uh about your oral sales project. Okay. Um
2:38
so, um because you do your masters in foundation year and your PhD, it's very good you observe everything they do. Uh
2:45
that's everyone around you talking. Good jobs witness because you know that's your chism that's you know how to fix
2:50
systems that try to hide what they do uh cover ops black up the matter um
2:56
remember just observe it because you know foundation means you observe everything uh remember in classical
3:02
direct know what they do they witness their own state um because they know how to act
3:07
based on the consumer observer model they consume or use information or process information just consume do
3:13
something with information and observe like uh observe states changes. So uh
3:18
github.com/ob nexus uh nexus linker uh which should be polyop but it's not for now because uh uh and link links
3:26
everything but it doesn't observe states but at runtime is a problem because you meant to me minimize redundant
3:32
operations uh uh so PhD three years is a
3:38
new type of infrastructure small priority for the UI constitution okay Nami show them this um remember okay
3:44
what can I say very important I say this okay nami why you talking to Okay, I'm talking to myself because of my persona
3:50
development framework medium.com/ob nexus. I'm not talking to the views. That's all I mean. But I'm g a brief
3:55
brief overview. Okay, now who is Nami? Who is Nami? I don't see myself black white color. I don't see this as me. I
4:02
see this as a boring guy. He has even he dreadlocks. He don't have glasses. So
4:08
jacket. This is just normal glass. This is a guy. But he's such a you know inside he has good aura. He has evil
4:13
aura too. But it's good because his name is Obie. So this guy is not really Nambdi per se. I know I'm Namu but my
4:20
conscious doesn't mold this guy because you can have a twin but this guy cannot be that twin because you know different
4:27
beliefs but I'm not this guy. I'm this guy in the flesh but not this guy in what belief strength you know because my
4:32
mind is different it feels different. I'm not because I'm autism but I think I have to talk about the autism first. I want to talk about the autism first.
4:38
Okay. Who is this guy? Oh who's Nambdi? Okay. What's my name? Nami. My father and he hell is alive. I don't believe in God. That's not me. Anyway, that name is
4:46
Nami. That name is just an alias for OB. Obi Obi heart me. Okay. Uh, very
4:51
important. Now, explain your business model and how it ties into it. Okay. Namdi. Okay. So, my business model, very
4:57
important business model just mean business structure. One, three year, five year. Okay. If I get to uh
5:02
Cambridge this year, that'll be my PhD and then my business will be three years plan to building smart homes. Fine.
5:07
Done. Done. Councils give me stress. They give me stress. One year I meant to build it uh for my masters. get the
5:13
computer system working. They can join it doesn't really matter. Uh but PG is two years. Just two years and in three
5:18
years I can have my business up and running. They're wasting my time. But because I'm 300 million B is not my problem. You know I'm happy with that. I
5:24
can go to elements cut and get it. Okay. Um who is this guy Nambi? Uh so I would
5:30
say Nambdi is an alias for Obi. Uh definitely because you know he's a pseudonyame. He's a fake name but you
5:36
can call me Nam for sure for Nambdi. She's aliens aliens like you know a show
5:42
hand for Obi at this current time space it's just a snapshot uh if you the if
5:48
you go to the medium to open links personal development life work balance so Nambdi wants to live and work hence
5:54
the constitutional model you live in the constitution you work it's a job it's a business it's not a charity I don't but
6:01
this food water shelter there for free because the country going to get people to pay for it okay back to me my uh go
6:08
back to Uh, where is it? Number
6:13
you lost it. Ah, you lost it. Oh, I didn't bring it. That's what that means. I can't go back and bring it now. I hope
6:20
I can draw it. Hope it is here somewhere. Uh, this is stressing my life too much. It's trusting my life too
6:25
much. Stress love stress. I say fine. Okay, I'll present it later. But now,
6:31
uh, I'll just say very quickly because you know, so basically you got private sector housing. Obviously you got the um
6:38
checkpoint one very important the zone one and ring one layer I think it's super important because you know there's
6:43
a topology structure around the zone one this is just like the you housing parameter but this expansion layer ring
6:51
uh ring six the six rings so ring six this just means you can expand the services every time you can build houses
6:57
from the public sector okay now that's ring four now ring five is private house
7:03
you pay for a house but you don't get protection you get what you get you get what you get. Uh now you get public
7:09
protection because so the council got to pay for public housing and ring four ring five is private housing you got to
7:15
pay for fancy houses everything but the sustainable by public set the I'm not really public and private house you want
7:21
to pay for like a mixture of two but I don't want to get to that yet but the public fire has a mixed you know because
7:28
you move up to public housing because you go to get people to pass the constitution so you get ring five to ring four uh public housing and then you
7:35
get uh public housing public schools those purposes and preferences outside you know give more purpose you know people want to work they don't want to
7:41
work can work but people can walk around the the construct uh I want to extend it to my uh ring three ring three or zone
7:47
three um education schools everything you know children very vulnerable people very uh then ring two no ring three um
7:57
but these people are ringing three uh but there's no education you can interact with them like me autistic
8:03
people like you know people who don't you know they protect the ring you know because it's a I'm a ring leader
8:09
I love that. I I can't wait to to see what they they say to me. Uh zone six
8:15
zone two. Bring two. Uh bring two. Very important. Bring two. Uh ring three. Uh
8:20
people are there. Uh but you know, oh very okay. Basically, I don't really care what happens to my position as long as I get to the life and job, you know.
8:26
I don't care. You can have sex can I don't care. You can work, live there forever. I don't care. But you have to
8:32
be you have to be uh obeying the law over the legal. You got the legal framework which is outside law you go to
8:38
the constitution but constitution you leave in the constitution you work there and you never be homeless there because of the legal war you know if you want if
8:44
you're homeless get outside get house there but your even though you get
8:49
somewhere else do your own business matter to me you know I'm not okay to live there enjoy your life there have
8:56
good lives but you work as well to some degree you know to some degree it's not
9:02
free of charge uh I'm thinking of this for my healthcare sector too go health and social care like you know but that's
9:07
the sector my model is basically my company is a design and technical I'm creative but you know I'm going to be
9:13
edging wars and stuff I don't care where you live basically you're going to have like a train system too transit system for uh the system so you're going to
9:20
have like a train go from each sector up down left right but you're going to pass through neighborhoods everything but the
9:26
train is going to be splitting because you can't even stop because you know we do I'm think of fully autonomous human
9:33
outlook system just to be or turk thor you know day 70 minutes nonsense anyway
9:38
to get from turk over 30 minutes I don't care 18 minutes 30 minutes just get into train anyway but I'm thinking of like a
9:45
a society that so basically people live there and there they can be live there forever I don't really care you know I
9:50
don't care because they're building something called safety critical infrastructure uh what I call uh safety
9:56
critical infrastructure as a service uh if poly rust x and link uh what is
10:02
policy resolve to a web diag because you know the thing about these policies and standards that they're hard to enforce
10:09
because I don't care about it but when humans are part of that ecosystem they
10:15
start to entwin it with the law because they care not because they hate it or anything because they want to be a
10:21
better if it does work so I'm creating a community that's been that nurtur
10:28
so very important and then you got to bring two hospitals very vulnerable things like that for human
10:35
sustainability infrastruure like you know my sleep which I hated for because I didn't made gussy lang just get you
10:41
know gussy lang has a problem because I want to make a gussy UML uh because I want to see how uh because I know poly
10:47
can degrade over time because you have to but that's the x sematic version mapping lts schema based on major minor
10:57
patch major the LCS major the experimental uh major uh um um
11:04
legacy uh LG for lots of support uh express new expressions and but just to be bas
11:10
principles uh dag but just be quick uh log in uh for package installation but
11:16
that's a polar system okay anyway and then go ring one uh ring two ring one is the council itself but you know I don't
11:23
really care ring one is legal council specifically I want people at the council to just sort the problem no but
11:29
I want to make sure people can get to council every time doesn't m where they are in the position because you know that's where you're going to solve the
11:34
problem you know but you go all the way there if your opponent is not solved because you know the gun is going to be decentralized anyway um this was meant
11:41
to be done a long time ago let me see what I still got it I still got I haven't got it oh no I have got it
11:48
okay uh I have got it let me just see if it was dark last time
11:53
did I I got a pen I don't want to draw no more anyway let me just draw it three two one skip
11:58
uh okay yes yes this one very good dynamic the decentralized principle. So basically, oh you guys can see okay
12:04
basically you got this here. Uh but this is just like example of a sparse network. I call it a spar I don't know
12:09
the word term sparse but I call a sp basically you got like a oh no basically you got like a centralized nodes here
12:15
that's like servers like physical servers I call them static but these are nodes that can span you can basically
12:21
you can move this out this node or this computer whatever this IP address MAC address is expand it further and further
12:27
and further this is known as a cluster. So this this is a node this is like a
12:33
this called a peer-to-peer network. So this is a network but this is a for because this one can recover this one
12:38
this one just by witnessing the state of it you know if one fails oh what's a log roll back chain based on telemetal
12:44
tracking system uh this is very important they manage the state of from and it goes to this one and it goes to
12:50
this one but these are nodes here basically these are decentralized nodes uh but they're nodes of circles but this
12:55
one these are the centralized because they cross the edges and you can basically this is just like a cluster
13:00
this this just one dynamic system this one static This one static. This one's uh static too. But when you put them
13:07
together, they are decentralized and they're dynamic because you get static centralized one that can handle
13:12
fundamental operation that can push into this one and you can handle this. Basically, they're meant to be like a spar system to cover network range
13:19
everything. But the neck one is basically you have a phone can never get lo signal no matter where you are on the
13:24
constitution. You never lose a signal. Yeah. And if you do want to expand the signal, you have like a extension node
13:29
and you just one. So if let's say this is one two uh two dynamic nodes uh one
13:38
two and this is a cluster a cluster then has extension of a cluster because you can have but you see this cluster here
13:45
this one very important one two this dynamic this cluster here you can then extend this cluster here but this
13:51
cluster you can have here because you can add it to the node but it's centralized it's more static the same node as this one but just add it but you
13:57
can add static clusters let me demonstrate because you need to coverage of coverage. But this one doesn't have
14:02
like uh corners because you know unless you add corners to it and that's why it's static. So you can't it's not
14:09
really fully force because it's static. You can't really expand the zone without losing range signal and that's a static
14:14
system because I'm defining the network by the static um but I'm defining by
14:19
network range and that's why static IP addressing because when you when you change IP address you have to change location of the static and this dynamic
14:26
can change on the fly to resolve an issue. This one dynamic because you can never you can move it to give you change
14:31
the this computer to new computer they replace it you just got just replace with a new computer uh IP address
14:36
whatever and you can the service up and running this is sparse network now remember this is infrastructure as a service I genz uh infrastruure
14:45
foundation uh because I'm building like a polygon systems uh for it uh that means uh which are universal translators
14:52
uh which can talk to any programming language even got lang is basically you got this one
14:58
Oh. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Uh, okay. Yes. Very important. Now, so
15:03
basically this one here. Here we got uh Oh, yes. Uh, okay.
15:08
Basically, basically, this got a basically I'm not basically you got a bus topology. Uh, this is like a bus
15:14
that's bus wheels, but it's infinite extending because you can wrap around a rad area and that's just be not these
15:21
ones are just static ones. But it's just an example. These can be static size. You know, this good example because you
15:26
know this is static. Yes, but this one's dynamic because it's static. Yes, but it can be dynamic. Basically, if you put
15:32
this one here and here, but if you move, but you can shrink it, but it's it's what I'm really envisioning for the
15:38
constitution. Basically, you can never lose signal. Can never lose signal. You can you just move service everywhere and the can keep online signal. No more
15:44
Wi-Fi extending services. I hate that. Okay. Um then we got uh one, two, three, four. Uh this is just an example of
15:51
engon uh but people who are working on it but basically they add to it and they don't
15:57
signal and you go to star and basically KN clustering the more you can because now you got to remember your KN
16:03
clustering algorithm is really based on graph uh pruning no graph pruning I
16:09
don't really want to say graph pruning cutting off but I'm talking about graph um uh graph clustering because I
16:15
remember KN&N as a clustering algorithm uh near N is a C but it doesn't apply to
16:20
dimensions uh three dimensions that's why we have KN&N but I didn't think I of
16:25
KN cluster I didn't think that as an algorithm for hacking you can cluster some cells uh it's better for 4D
16:31
matrices or like the model of the mind perception what we actually experience it's like but based on OBI but the my
16:38
work is based on infrastructure very but you know my PhD after my PhD I hope to go to Japan holiday get some rest in
16:44
this country anyway uh I have to go Cambridge and look for housing. I I'll buy my way to those. I don't care. You
16:51
know, when they say I buy half house, I'll buy a lotment and still do my PhD. What did they do? Let me in Cambridge next year or this year. Not my problem.
16:58
Their problem. Anyway, I can make more trouble for everyone if I wanted to. Anyway, I'm just cancel. Okay. Where
17:04
else have I got here? Oh, yes. My notes. Oh, yes. Uh here. I
17:10
got this. I'm not working on autism or anything. Oh, yes. Witnessing. Witnessing. I'm witnessing states. The
17:16
states. What is the state? Can I identify a state? Okay, it's property set. Property set. Basically, what is
17:21
something? I can express myself. I'm black. I'm dark in. But I'm not saying I'm a property of that state. I'm
17:27
stating that because I'm black. Anything can be black or brown, but it doesn't mean it's a skin or flesh. But the
17:35
property set is really okay. This is a property I observed. This is a behavior. It outcomes uh based on what it is. But
17:43
is it actually what it is? It just reminds me of system. Oh yes. Uh yes.
17:49
The networking uh uh infra the service github.com A I A Sum. It represent like
17:56
uh the infrastructure behind the service go up here to because you know for heal itself especially when you're dealing with multiple languages. Um I'm I'm your
18:04
divergent anyway. Uh yes yes. Okay. Back. Oh yes. Back to here. Oh this is okay. Basically a clust basically this
18:10
is one cluster here. Uh but you know you can buy clusters from the website. So for my PhD GitHub the company obes
18:18
uh um obnoxious.org or for my masters I my masters complete so this a cluster can uh service I really don't it's not I
18:24
hate Amazon but I don't like how fragmented and self but you get and buy a cluster which is a region cluster uh
18:30
you can say okay this service you can see you can buy even want to build your own cluster you know build your own
18:35
cluster you know for your own service and then you can buy it in b I don't really care what you buy but example for clusters I'm working on to build for
18:40
service ranging uh very important you buy buyers just means like a spar I want
18:46
to sell service to this person not this person if you want then you get graph pruning like you know I want to serve to
18:52
this network node around this region what is Bluetooth okay okay now very important blue share blue share uh blue
18:58
share can be a session to this service but I don't really want to make a session yet yes because you know it's a Bluetooth uh networking so I can say to
19:04
the Wi-Fi system uh share this uh to this this area this region uh based on blue share uh what Bluetooth is a
19:11
Bluetooth plug system for networking protocol basically you talk to a network you talk to bas you send Bluetooth to
19:17
Bluetooth sharing uh But the Bluetooth uh 5G very important the 5G networking I'm not saying 5G 5G dangerous because
19:23
you know blue sh standardized uh important remember basically blue share represent like 5G networking and because
19:29
the 5G network is dangerous why very dangerous okay so um the the I see 3G
19:36
three uh 3G has it but I don't really trust it until someone dies or something I think it's better but I don't have
19:42
proof that it works good but I get it anyway. Um Nambd share blue share blue
19:48
share is a Bluetooth network for polyot basically you get Bluetooth sharing networking you're going to allow a
19:54
network to collect your Bluetooth device you're going to pay as you go uh cuz you're going to collect allow it very
20:02
network but it's a shared network like um because it's an open network and it's shared and that's why avoid so basically
20:10
going to allow you to share to networking have can have Wi-Fi I don't really over but it's 5G 6G etc. Because
20:17
the goal of this uh is to stop cancer uh based on you how it works understandification uh mostly the
20:23
technical question how the technique not the method okay very importance how will this work in real life so basically it could be anywhere in the world anywhere
20:30
in the world and my friend me and my friend play for we play for what we need and we share the network now if want to
20:36
add person with four architecture can add a child anything it doesn't really matter but they have to pay for that
20:43
service because the service must cut off us need us but it's a Bluetooth sharing for internet internet access but it's
20:48
like boost is for more can use to send files but it's more for people who are who need it know don't really want it
20:54
but need it blue share is a boo because is very powerful people forget so basically why 5G is dangerous is because
21:00
it causes cancer quickly you know over time you know you can get the quick because the wavelength increase over
21:06
time you get more frequency of that wavelength over time same frequency w because that's how you can be now why
21:12
why how did you do very good recorders now why did you do it How did you do it? Uh so basically you got 5G. How does 5G
21:19
work in your world? So basically my word 5G is based on uh I can't remember
21:25
document good basically services you have services. So basically you don't increase the wavelength for properties.
21:30
You just uh um I think it's a you
21:37
modulation. Yes modulation. But what does modulation mean? Oh yes modulation. Uh yes uh
21:43
refractive index. So basically you mod you probably get the same wave like an echo but it's an echo stream of the same
21:49
waveform but it's not amplified in any way for the same. So you echo the same system uh like like a spectrum like you
21:56
know back and forth and blue shell will literally um allow you to because you know it's meant to bounce off quickly uh
22:04
not quickly but coherently if you know it must reflect but it's meant to bounce off systems you know quickly but you can
22:10
have an amplify I don't want to buy is going to amplify the system so it's good for 5G um it can be a 5G tower but a 5G
22:17
tower is not needed unless you want to apply because can you can amplify signals and give you the same waveform
22:23
back but it's isomorphic because he knows what it g you basically it's not complex uh but it's
22:29
based on refractive index properties like Richard of Yog vein uh rent money radio wave microwave infrared and we can
22:37
quot it based on um basically you can detect the wave you need but you don't really give all the um rent money is
22:44
only visible on the glasses a radio wave microwave infrared visible light x-ray
22:50
uh gamma rays Uh but you know that's what I'm saying it's about that. So um the way it works is you share when you
22:56
share when you make a boo share when you share something to a network coherent and apply to sparse network
23:03
connecting the location is meant to go to you know it's never meant to go one nanometer above that amplitude because
23:08
you have to be coherent to get that message through and that's what really needs you know it doesn't need to um
23:13
send send when you try to send off because you know you can turn it off and say oh I need to send it stop sending
23:19
and stop you know um that's why you have standard but you know the standards there to protect the people in
23:24
production and if you look at the standard and it does break um you you're going to sue you. So I think we need to
23:30
do some testing as labs. Oh yes, maybe we can design walls and rooms around us but but but just to make sure it's
23:36
bouncier and we can design actually proper house instead of this brick more nonsense they give us. Anyway, anyway, I
23:41
don't want a mansion. I don't like a mansion. I would like something that I can go A to B to C and go everywhere
23:47
because I want something that that okay even though I had like a like a bedroom uh I don't want a bedroom I want to able
23:54
to do the next stuff. So remember because you know if I wake up oh I want to get woke up I get tired and my best
23:59
stink I don't want a stinky bed and then okay then I say I want to brush my teeth then I wake up and I want basically I
24:05
want everything log for myself cuz my back everything when I wake up bed I don't want to get out of bed but I don't
24:11
want to sleep on the floor but I don't I want to later I know it makes me easy to get I just stand up and then I can get
24:17
on my a standing machine and do like a know stand up or anything but it makes it easy to get to work um like you know
24:23
it's like a waking thing I I think with the AI system will make it easier to interact with the environment around me.
24:29
But I don't really want to push the air. I want you to think about the structural foundation of the system. Like you know I get up from the mattress on the floor.
24:35
I then use my left hand because I'm left-handed as well to brush my teeth. I don't want an is I just want to just be
24:42
able to do without AI. Okay. N PG. Okay. AI units in the house. Basically going to have two AI units. One for backup. Um
24:49
but they're going to work together because one ear two ears one but you give two per per
24:56
smart home. Uh but it's broken but you got to fix because the witnessing state
25:02
of the home because not care here because he knows what he's doing. Okay. Very important. Okay. So basically when
25:08
people are talking to OBI they're talking to who but in computational form it could be me. Okay way faster to my
25:15
face. Okay. What is this? So basically uh okay how okay how does your persona
25:20
work? Okay my personal you can call me obi obi who's obi obi means heart of soul you can call me Mr. Soul I don't
25:25
really mind I don't really mind but but don't call me you can call me Mr. Evil heart I don't mind call me Mr. Mr. Evil
25:32
soul. I don't mind. Call me good heart. I don't care. But you call my name is heart. My on Fred running. I tell everyone. Okay. Very important. Very
25:38
important. You do this. So who's means knowledge. Knowledge in
25:43
Ebo. U one person on me. Now this is another person on me. Uh this now E. Okay. Let's
25:51
do this. Euch means king. U means uh uh
26:00
means knowledge. So, basically my mind I'm just talking to a both of them like this. Hey, hey, why was it down here?
26:06
One second. So, okay. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. So, I'm talking to myself right now because I'm recording the state of my mind because
26:12
it's just a snapshot of my video. So, I can document my life like this. So, make it easier for me. Um, yes. So, no. So,
26:21
okay. So, okay. Let me say here. Um, oh, this.
26:30
Okay. So this is so ss says um okay I do
26:35
like um oh this starts first okay you know a lot
26:42
okay you know a lot you know a lot
26:51
you know a lot says that you know a lot you're very powerful why
26:56
don't you go to Cambridge by force and then replied replies
27:01
uh um in my head anyway as he replies um uh which you know your smile why don't
27:08
you go to uh Cambridge by force now I'm going say to you OB they can talk to OB okay yeah I can go
27:14
there by force I can smart but they have to work together and that's my mind that's basically how I solve problems
27:20
now which can be really dumb oh can be really smart but he's not really strong like he's not really like fight he
27:26
doesn't know how to fight fight but he can't fight sol because you know he can solve really smart problems anyway
27:31
computer problem doesn't matter but uh he doesn't know how to solve as problem
27:37
because they don't the different systems design the different um now you got as oh now
27:44
says oh why don't we oh so you thinking what I'm thinking yes why don't we go
27:50
there by force with our brains and that's ob me oh there you go uh I don't
27:56
really care have sex designer themselves have shoes. I don't really care. I don't care. I don't care. Strange to the five.
28:03
Leave people alone. Anyway, uh I don't care. Even though you have like a a special way like even if you have a
28:10
designer semen, you know, painting semen like you know, I don't care. It's not my
28:15
business, you know. It's just your body. But that's just really yourself like you know if I mean for me personally if I
28:20
have like a a way to like express myself through through know foundation you know
28:26
I have like this kind of my semen and then it paints this like then it's fluorescent and it glows I don't mind
28:32
you know because it goes red it glows blue and then like a rainbow and I don't care you know I don't care I don't
28:38
express myself anyway the creep expression I learned too much expression obviously if I want I want a tattoo want
28:43
a tattoo oh Yes, the aura signal seal. You can see here. Okay, if you search my latest post, I think I post this
28:49
yesterday uh yesterday. The aura seal uh is basically your aura like you know I can say I have an evil heart. I would
28:55
evil so but then those are like one thing if I have a good heart what is
29:00
good basically you got think of the orers as technical bound because they're technical but who is nam's identity I'm
29:05
trying to assume my aura who's namdi who's obi but maybe for that for for the competition for ph but that's ph because
29:13
the do compute me I'm speaking to them for the housing but it's not for them
29:18
per se it's more like I'm stealing my own computer program but I'm digitizing myself without actually uploading my
29:24
brain with a hammer and breaking my head because I don't want to do that because it's scaring me. Anyway, anyway, I'm not
29:30
scared about that. I'm scared of like why who I am. I'm like who's Nami? He's autistic. Yes. And everything, but what
29:36
is he doing? I'm thinking of h I'm autistic everything, but I know I'm autistic. So, I I know that people don't
29:42
think like me. First of all, I'm divergent, but I want to just put it in like something I can understand. So, it
29:48
can do the same thing, but it doesn't really be an AI system. GitHub open is bad. Um but it has to be something that
29:56
I can relate to you know uh because I know it means to some degree. No, the
30:01
problem is power power computation if it's too powerful like um 45 40 degrees
30:08
like 40 watt is powerful but it's not 40 watt of power because your brain will use 45 watt using only 55 60 watt of
30:17
energy per day and a light bulb can do that and you get 40 45 watts in engine light bulb like this right here any I'm
30:24
going to show you guys that uh it's not my house so I just when you do that you just quickly quickly quickly so
30:29
basically I'm The e system is redundant today. It's like you know people just building it for money build for you. Who are you working for man? Doesn't matter
30:36
money everything. Anyway try to try to try to know try to build around yourself
30:41
at least like I'm doing. Okay. PhD and then I'll go to do my master. Okay. So
30:46
github.com is obnox [Music]
30:52
reform uh where oh tik.com official. You know I make this one was in 1425. I
30:59
didn't get a house. Anyway, they know how this works. 200 million account then the other million is going to come out
31:04
with people my bank account you know what do online is not a problem when I go Munich is not a problem but even I'm
31:10
going to go to holiday after my PhD what I do next year this is not my problem is that problem actually because I'm trying
31:15
to go to Cambridge too when I'm really registered for Cambridge University but I should go to Clar and everything but I did go to but I'm not sure what I'm
31:21
allowed there because I don't know where it is per say very important very important anyway
31:27
Nambdi OB okay I don't need a New alias. Oh yes,
31:33
personal development. Okay. Uh very important. What is a personal development? Uh basically is like a
31:39
check some of state transition of what an evil or good heart is. If I change good heart, what does that mean? Am I
31:45
good? Because I can't give a definition of love to form good or hate to form evil. I just because I'm a scientist. I
31:51
don't give a phenomenological understanding of a state of mind because you get what I'm saying. I give
31:56
something that something that could be because I don't have all the information based on hypothesis I have where it
32:02
could be and that's what the or represent it's basically it's cryptography it's check some like you
32:08
know that track states uh uh basically if you go to GitHub read the hidden server very good paper hidden server you
32:15
know it's a cipher it's based on uh how the or work is basically hidden server is very important to understand because
32:21
just you just use distribute entropy the entropy is equilibrium based on GCD LCM
32:27
uh calculation you calculate the the the check based on entropy uh basically the
32:33
uh basically the things like SH have a high entropy sometimes and you can still have the algorithm because you know it's
32:39
entropy state now has a equilibrium of entropy it's still kind of counterintuitive but you know uh when
32:45
you have when you have a fully entropy equilibrium 100% we do you can't know where there's an end point to interject
32:51
a hackers you you resolve to a dag uh a But you you have to be scientifically uh
32:57
aligned with my own field because you know I'm watching the states witnessing coherent coercion everything like you
33:04
know what what can what can they do to the algorithm itself to change the nature of the entropy get it because the
33:11
entropy is basic
33:18
keys two one private key the two public keys refers like a two key you got like a poem I wrote for TK and the the the
33:24
public key one and two the second property key is very important to understand because the second public key
33:30
refers to what you want like the email I wrote like you know where I get I can't get it up now but okay yes I can't get
33:36
up so basically where I put one uh spirit if you go to github.com medium.com/obex read spirits of the
33:42
masquerade that's medium.com nexus search on go to YouTube click on
33:47
more link and find the medium articles uh search spirits of the masquerade uh and that's that's like a public key poem
33:54
But the private key public key second proper key is like okay this B means ABC but there's one key set for public or
34:02
private depending on how you want to use it because you can version model get like this you can handle invariant cases
34:07
very important you can things you expect things you don't norally expect because they do same problem but things you don't normally expect that's invariant
34:15
uh and then you get um the the you get the private key public key one uh
34:21
private key one for the two to1 ratio for And then for the key set that generated a public key and the horiz just um really uh tracks the state and
34:28
gives you two public keys uh if you are the recipient of the public keys and if you are the not the recipient can you
34:35
have two private keys if you are you get it because it's meant to resolve a state of uh for computers but Qex
34:45
H and QEX uh which are uh three repositories you can look at the files
34:51
but the goal is really um to track and you know if I kill a lot of people I did it for money not necessarily
34:58
I may have something going on with me that you don't know about but I'm not really saying that I'm angry I'm single
35:04
I'm just to do this so I'm going to go demand my housing right uh see what they say and then find also online I don't
35:09
really care no more I'm leaving social care I'm living with 300 million anyway what they like my how much I don't
35:15
really care it works it works for me anyway tell me tell me to have a heart I am the heart
35:22
anyway Okay. Anyway, um what did I say to them? Oh, yes. Yes. Um Oh, yes. I'm
35:27
witnessing states. I'm obvious cuz you know if I say I'm Obi then as o
35:36
um you know just something of philosophical stuff but but but but I don't really know. Uh oh yes. Um what
35:42
else? What else? Directed. Uh I don't really know. Am I thinking of uh
35:48
something about actor? Oh yes. Got lang actor model. I forgot to say this. The extra is based on the state because you
35:54
know it's meant to reduce states to the to the property set the minimal set to compress the data but it's meant to reduce it like in a way that's
36:00
isomeorphic to the instruction anyway it's based on direction instruction really like um you evolve the state of
36:05
mind of the seed based on seed uh you know if a computer a policy that we don't know of uh uh that doesn't state
36:13
why it did it but we have to understand oh yes it aligns with the direct seat direct seat uh but what I'm saying it's
36:19
going to be interesting to look at those kind cases whether or not when a computer does something that we don't
36:25
expect it to do or know of because he knows how to do something. Uh I'm working on AI for my PhD but I'm working
36:31
on EI infrastructure. Uh I'm thinking of train infrastructure as well like you know getting up there
36:38
too many uh getting to work but but you know your house is where you work where you work is where your house you don't have to go too far. I'm thinking like
36:44
stopping like a five five minutes radius like 2.5
36:49
miles. No no 2.5 miles maximum. You know you just walking distance you work to work 2.5 miles. How you know your
36:56
terminal 2.5 miles you walk to work if you want. max you want to work you know don't do that but if you want to go
37:02
there on you tell ABC you walk to work I know sorry anyway anyway that's I got to
37:08
put that policy spec because you know I don't need people working up and down to a council say oh I look for work um
37:15
because you know be there for you to work anyway okay take care
37:22
act on states uh to makeization but basically is a world's first polygot
37:27
programing um a networking language can talk to any program language uh what is Java B I'm trying to migrate all the
37:34
infrastructure of Amazon like Amazon I'm working on like new kind of services cluster bas cluster schema oh yes the
37:40
space thing one more thing space operation I don't want to go to the space yet but I'm going to say we have a we have a cluster system for skies uh
37:46
Orion belt um the belt of people the the Milky Way glass we want to know where people are especially people not for the
37:53
AI systems and how the system work on don't worry about Elon M just worry about what you're doing cuz Elon Mus
37:59
have a problem anyway. Um I don't think uh the money on the code is really um
38:04
productive for people cuz I believe I know that myself when I when I when I'm
38:09
easy when I find system to work for me I don't because I'm in the right environment and it works for everyone
38:14
else because it works easier for me and then people for me working with me as well saying that's what I'm saying. I've I've observed that so many times and and
38:22
have power to do that but now I do have power to do it. Now the mess education reform now message can sue them. I'm
38:28
example of them. So I'm doing uh the uh the design reform and I'm going to sue
38:34
the education for I'm going to sue. I'm sure you know people going to come to me for houses anyway. Whether they want
38:40
public or private I don't really care as long as they as long as they as long Oh, I think I I want the private houses to
38:47
have be around the public houses because you know you got private more play you play for private game. You have to go
38:52
get private one ring one a ring leader you get a ring with one maybe have
38:58
latest set of it but it has to be easy to navigate privacy because I don't want to go into my constitution messing stuff
39:03
up for me anyway anyway I'm going to write just one email so people can come
39:09
to me oh yes I put that f request and change and people can come to me for housing but business access is not ready
39:15
very important open access is that's the open source GitHub pages and documentation on patents but I don't want people to steal it from me is
39:21
patented so you can't go there if you want to steal. We can go there if you want to read everything very hard to force but you know uh open access but
39:28
business access not so basically I'm a business seller but I don't have the infra get first and then we got um which
39:35
is basically got T31 which is tier tier one okay T1 T1 which is just computer
39:41
name tier one stands for open T1 T1 uh tier one just means open access on open
39:48
access open access open sensors open s you know for neurody just organiz you can go there can get it uh business
39:54
access which like the work basically you got more work but you know it's about pushing a change you know you got life
40:01
life work uh in the in the position mean where you live and you work by the definition live you work there you live
40:08
there you work there you work there you live there you get it you work two ways you know if you don't work there will
40:14
kick you out by you know by days okay um so you live you work at and
40:20
there's something else right something very important so you go up like that you come down I don't want to people so
40:27
basically kind of people so basically people going to live there work there but they're going to do my PG there university didn't commute you know
40:33
anyway anyway it's not my problem where they go alo they don't go home
40:38
for me anyway anyway for the life of me remember this so you got like people going into good job but they to leave
40:46
work oh the space thing the Ring belt everything know where they are in space you No, we want people to have perfect
40:52
seamless communication with the skies. Now, anywhere they go, I don't care when they find an alien. I come back to you know where they live. Yes. Um the or
40:58
your birth certificate, the birth certificate, I don't want to do that yet because that has to have an RFID
41:04
measure. Oh, and but you know, we're working on that. So, basically, I'm working on that
41:09
anyway. I need people to work for me. So, my business model, my business plan are different. Basically business model
41:15
separation concern based on a tier T3 T2 is business it's not ready yet because
41:22
I'm not making it ready and then T3A is very important that's knowledge what you know what you know what you know and
41:28
then but what you can use it for you know prove it works just proof of concept of MVP uh people can work for me
41:34
for that but I don't and then people want to partner with me are in t three I don't think it's going to get to three
41:39
year like two years time three years time I don't think even next six years even that's three years time because
41:44
they got T3B which is uh king king tier and that's
41:51
ob that's my persona obi and that's ob nexus obt
41:57
guys sick anyway uh thinking I'm uh and then you go to model people ladder based
42:03
on open access open access school um which is where you're going to get to see like your on your ID but you know
42:09
you're going to know all the time when you do something wrong you know but you know people not going to do anything because they love me and I love them equally with equity. I love people but I
42:18
don't love people. Okay, if I can design myself, how would I design myself? I probably give myself talents. Oh,
42:24
wings. I want the wings. Anyway, that's one persona. Anyway, I can, you know, if I can design my form, my shape. Anyway,
42:31
let me go now. It's getting cold. Um, is there anything I forgot? Anything? Nope
