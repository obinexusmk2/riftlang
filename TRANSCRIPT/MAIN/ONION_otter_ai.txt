Speaker 1  0:00  
Yes, okay, my video, this video, is very important to me and everyone else. Basically, for me personally, it means a lot, because five years old, I'm like, four years old right now, I don't want to tell anything I'm in a room to me should wear room house, anything, but I'm gonna get a house, but it's gonna take time. But, you know, because the person don't hurt me, it's autistic, and they don't help me. So first, and first anyone that's a that's not a Gen Z,

Unknown Speaker  0:38  
basically, you have to be between 1955 1995 1985

Unknown Speaker  0:43  
two to 1985

Speaker 1  0:47  
98 or five. You know Jay Z business, 1980 2012 let me calculate the 2012 minus 2012 minus 25 years. It's 1987 but 1987

Unknown Speaker  1:02  
is not. Seven is not Gen Z.

Speaker 1  1:04  
Is it? No, no, okay, I think I'll keep it there, you know, because that's like it basically 2025

Unknown Speaker  1:13  
2012 1998 1998

Unknown Speaker  1:18  
plus 25 years,

Speaker 1  1:21  
24 that's a Gen Z. So basically, I want to keep the definition if you're born between 1919 1987 and personally, five years after that, that's my generation, Gen Z. I'm going to just put that there. Basically going to get New Jersey's after this section, alpha. But, you know, I know that it's 1997 19 seven to 2012 you know, not only service Gen Z, but I had 25 years for before, because I'm 25 so this keep for now, because, you know, I, you know, I prefer this one was too lineage. A lot of people gonna be in a position, you know, because, you know, 2012 is like an end of Gen Z, anyway. So, you know, there's a new generation, alpha. I'll start here, 2013 but, you know, just keep everyone from 2012 to 1987 just so can have a diversity. You know, a non enough complaint. So today's video is an onion systems. Onion systems. Let me be frank, onion onion listening this video a long time ago. Oh, but, you know, I didn't want to rush it, so let's do it properly. Where are you going? Nnamdi, for this

Unknown Speaker  2:31  
system, are you

Unknown Speaker  2:33  
how much in the back? No, no. So

Speaker 1  2:36  
I've got, like, a pages. I'm just looking too low, but I can't find all of them because them because, you know, I just like,

Unknown Speaker  2:44  
lost them. I just like, kind

Speaker 1  2:47  
of scattered in my head, because not really expanding it, you know. So basically, how much you know? So on your systems. What is an onion system? Basically, they grows more and more layers, it hardens. We won't get to pour the onion like, you know, with the is, like, a kind of, like, very good, like, you know, when you peel on your layer, any layers of onions, the skins of so basically, the root cause onion is why you do something. It's, I call it the onion initiative. So you got the wheel initiative moving forward. Now we got the will using the Discover yourself. Now you got the discovery of yourself. You know, because of my losses and my other one is called Spirit anchor. Now we can anchor this. But you know, why am I doing what I'm doing? You know, my goal is Nigerian BFR, constitution, IW, where you live in your work and what else. Spray masquerade like, you know, instead of masking, instead of lying for just to get by, you lie for a purpose. This is to get back, to achieve an outcome, not just to solve the problem that's dead everyone can do, but like to attain more for yourself, only for yourself, or for the group of people you are working on. And the one I'm talking about, you got the pie initiative, like, you know, people, 145, is a non Indian number, because, you know, you can calculate that. I know you got the onions. Basically, this pie has onion. So the onion is like, you know, pie to onion. The real spins between the core of the onion is like a spin, like a go in, definitely. So the onion has a layer, so you pack layers of the system of the wise, like onion, why? So, like the onion has a smell present, like a corn, and we don't understand it, because people have their own if you need to go, like a real root of the four, the rule of corn, like you know. Why is it called root 34 nine, if you go, you got a root to the nine,

Unknown Speaker  4:52  
which means, like a root to the full,

Speaker 1  4:55  
everything has a cold version of it. So you can human beings. We. Is home everybody. That's his taboo. So suppose, like, you know, we have all the corn in the world, but we don't. Everyone's like, um, I'm doing corn, but corn is for um. Then they say, Okay, so see, basically that means that, basically there's no call you. You, obviously my album, I call something called you 34 which means, like, horn. Horn 34 so basically, a universe of corn. Therefore, because the root 34 means like, if it's a if it's a fantasy, if it's real, if it exists in a real world, there's a corn of it somewhere on the internet. You know, on the internet, but you know that's true of it. You go to dark web and find any point you want, but I rather know you guys go there. So basically, this for the onion system. So why we do have a kind of cone? Why are the kind of experience? You know, we're human beings. We don't we have consciousness, but we don't shoot that kind of cone. Or do we hear Mr. Being? I see a hypothetical. Basically, basically, this is very, this one. This is my Dana is like, now I'm trying to do this for me. So basically, this one turns one years old, beautiful onion systems, github.com, has opened his onion seem to, seem to Nnamdi,

Unknown Speaker  6:18  
yes, yes, no, this is seen more.

Speaker 1  6:21  
No, this, no. This is in 10. This in two. Here. Bum, this onion. This is this, like a open SS network with, like a four onion. But, you know, the tour on your router system is for the education. So basically, got this photoresist, polyglot system for onion indexing. You know, it's about authentic growth, but it's part of our own service in the real world, it's like a Muco a Muco UK. So basically, the goal of this is onion router. Onion Router can run through services like, you know, authentically, you know, as much as what you really thinking, you know. So we run but for speed, but for coherence, to transmit basically, basically the onion system. You pure the onion to understand the intent statement, expression, intentional, especially taboos, and interpretation of taboos and why things are taboo. You know things like that. Phenomenological engineer to see. You know, it's about understanding people's actions. You know when they kill someone. You know between a one day a criminal. You know it's about gathering this like a guitar, which basically got like a textbooks entry, my one in here, but it's framed like that. You go to repositories, repositories. Go to textbooks. Entries, textbook entries, textbooks. This one here is my onion. This was like a civil class initiative, like, you know, I'm trying to unpack my or also for why people are doing like this, but it's like my own evidence everything, a civil collapse of everything, yeah, or technical assembly, you know, it's my strategy board. You know, I look at the accounts for like an hour for you. I just is smart. But you know, this my holograms review all those who say to me decision letter, for example, is here because it's like a, so it's limited. It's just that it's not allowing me. But it's like, it's like my butterflies in the battlefield, my serial killer, everything, at least, like my, this is my personal development framework. So basically, it's personal development. And you know, this my typical entries, like a, there's like, a woman, I want to see apologize me. I don't really care about you myself. I am not scared of anyone. Okay, so three or four, if you start at age three or four, you allow the online service up to age seven or eight. No, automatically, my business running. So basically, when you're three or four, you play FIFA, but FIFA cannot preserve you. So I think I think I even want to make it 12 or 13 for your children. You know, you are okay. Let's talk in okay. Now, 12 or 13, three or four, I'm being around the real time, so I want to basically, so sure that it's calendars. Can get both kind of complete whose calendars game. But 12 is what, basically just about 1212. You know, at 13. Yet because you can feel like, if I'm three or four years old, I see all of those calendars, she would just kind of place your guidance, you know, because, you know, the person has to watch me. Sometimes we observe my state to see what I'm pressing information according to make sure that I'm pushing like, you know, like a human being, you know, I'm not being like, it's like a puppet, anti puppetry, you know, control if an adult or someone watching me do something I do properly, you know, we just human nature, because I'm being observed, and I know I'm being observed. So that's a problem. If I don't know I'm being observed, I'm being observed, I get a problem, you know. So it's about guiding my consciousness, my way, my growth. So basically, every encourage us to play with your children, on the Muco, you know, for me, three or four was seven. So 347, years of competition, years game, seven years. We can play 812, seven, 812, 1315, years games, because it go, you know, this is much you can play three layers, beginning, middle and end, to kill, no, but you know that go up a. I know, based on Peggy guidance here. So basically, I want to enforce this game room everything. But this is, this is onion system in action. So basically, onions, like, ensures that we are doing things according to how we're meant to do it, you know, based on our watershed. Basically because the watershed, which is like, you see, Holy Spirit. But, you know, can buy past that online. It doesn't make any sense. You know, can go online and get the same thing, but you know, you don't bypass it. You know, it's like, it's not that. So the only services are meant, we tell it to all the solutions is polygon. Is polygon. Basically, if I go to watch something, I'm going to watch EastEnders, 8pm I can stay over past, if you a child, you know, just, I don't even sleep anything 8pm I can just turn on the TV and then watch for 30 minutes and then go to sleep, and then my mom wouldn't know it. That's a big problem for me, in my constitution, you know, they said you guys are watching too much, you know. So the thing about this for me is, like, you know, it means that, you know, I'm very smart. I know I'm very smart because, you know, my generation behind normally care. So I become smarter than them because they're not actually watching my sleeper, my mom. I can get anything I want from the internet because, you know, I explore. So it's like Guided Exploration about curated and curated. Okay, your mom wants you to do it. You know, your mom encourages you to do it. Mom, mom, guys, changing, moms, guys, guys, you guys should understand your children. They're very small, but naturally, they have the infrastructure around them, and it's very loose, like we as a child. For me, sort of things Merlin, Merlin was even past like 1112, o'clock. What I saw? I saw, like a National Lottery. What was national then I saw the TV shut down on me, because, you know, I tried to do some gambling with my, my, you know, you know. But you know what? This is not working. They're stupid, you know, government's really caring about it. Okay? So, basically, three or four, nine years old. Nine years old. I was in eastern on the TV. But funny enough, my mom screaming against me. My brother wasn't eating this alone, and she didn't care you. Start to get agitated from a team. Start leaving, being lifted a family. Because, you know, following what's happening. In the shows. You know, shows anymore, systems, three to four, seven to 812, to 13, prison to 1617, to 18. We got the 18 to 26 so 19 to 2020 plus, three or 420, plus, 24 to 2625 to plus 7456, you just have count of the increments that you know the Peggy has encountered the maximum number. I think it's 30 because 18 plus 18 is 636.

Unknown Speaker  12:54  
Mature m plus

Speaker 1  12:57  
you got yours gold or guys used to do everything yourself. 36 years old. Read six years old of a house. I swear to God, I don't think you should be actually being in position, you know, but you should do it. So why did you do it? I don't bother me. You don't bother me. Credit, basically. See one more thing, listen, you also have property in the system, equity, like fully quality. Because, you know, if I'm four years old, I want to buy a 10 year game, you know, I want to buy scanners. I should wish you to buy calendar who I already have. You know, I love to pay my money and use this calendar. But if I want to get something like at this game before I go to 12 or 1312, or 13, that's the game I get. 12 or 13, you know? So I forget most support, because I'm not even meant to be at that level. People, if they do, right, the openness is, after school will be go up and get the game. So basically, I want people to have 12 or 13. Yes, yes. You know, three or four. You know games. You know, doesn't mean anything. What games are? Kind of Harry Potter 13. But you know, Delhi, hello, you know, like, what's that game? Faster, fewer, the magic one, you know, looking at which I love magic and killing people, but, you know, it's like a thick magic. It's like a magic because it's not really functional. You got like, like, what's his name? You know, what is games? You see, teenagers have a love, but no pool of duty. So I want people to go down the rating system, like, you know, go up the racing system. But, you know, go up Cohen, you know, I want to play a game. I mention my friend. I don't get hallucination. I sleep, well, I eat, well, you know, you know, then I say, oh, there's my heart, really. Well, you know, I'm not scared of anything in the real world. I know it's a game, you know? I know. I know I can navigate the real world without stabbing someone. Or for GTA six or GCA seven, GC six or GCA five, that's kind of a bad one. It's terrible. So like the skyline is saying the damages calendars, FIFA. Basically, if I'm paying FIFA, I'm three or four, I should be automatically getting a seven or eight. Now, this is a problem. Just stick with the FIFA. You know. You know nobody just like FIFA. Just keep a few. But everyone should just know the rest of the gaming. In weekly CDs. Okay? So that's saying to you guys, um, on your systems. Are that one more thing, parking wheel. So basically the William CTM, you keep moving. Oh, you know, this is my 15 or 16 guys. If you're three years old, I want you guys to play 18 years looking, I don't really care. You know, that's the boss work there, but the maturity is like kind of thing to take a money to buy a game. You know, I just want the ecosystem to show that the credit system offers real money, but he work there in your gaming city, you know, play games, but it's not just about the gaming. It's about the authentic relationship you have for the people around you. You know, are you speaking to this lady for money? You know, are you trying to harass this person human rights because he's an avatar? She's like, Are you being authentic? Shared interest to be around that person? I want you guys to understand that. For me, I don't speak to Lady really online, basically, guys, guys you know, don't ever look at someone like that. You know, like you know, look at the advertising. But you know they you know, please, please don't have someone online. It's kind of sickening. Now, there's too much. It's too much, you know, you get your grown man. Now, you know, people doesn't know me, design or else else up down. So you have to go up the ladder. You have equity. You know, no matter this, consistence is very important. So for every level three or four, you get consensus to get consistent to eat seven or eight, but because it's something that is coming withdrawn, you know, seven or eight to 12 to So, because the insurance, obviously, you can start like, a petition for that game. Like, I want to play his calendars from three or four, like, I want to play Mario Kart. I wish you selling your game, you know. And then I say that, Oh, I don't Mario Kart or whatever new game is, you know, either start position, we can get, like, people that want to play Mario Kart for that game, and, you know, if that game agrees, then we get the game for free, you know. But we don't, you know, guys, if you mess this up, you know, and you don't get that game for free, you know, it's gonna affect how the world is, you know, sees you, you'll find them, because it's a simple thing, guys, you work together. You create something together. You work together. You have a shared, mutual agreement. You get the game. You get a game. You have you want to get, you know, you place calendars. You play any battle royal mode. It's kind of you get the game, get the membership, get the royalty, the commission. But you don't go back. You have to go, you know, you don't, you don't need to take on this calendars. You know, when I accept kindness, you know, when I put it on one week, The Last of Us, guys, you know, guys, this is gaming system. It should be free, fun, enjoyable and competitive. You know what authentic? You know, especially self authenticity. You know, new code, spiritual, even the conscious or, you know, the real world, basically. So even, like a decent one, real world, trust you guys, you know, because you know, if I'm seven or eight and I have homework, so then I should be, like, able to interact to a teenager, 13 years old, I should be talking with detonism. You know that I'm saying to you, because Dean is a teenager. 12 to 13 is probably interesting. But, you know, it's just my advertising robot, like an ID system in the robot, play, meet up in a rural place and play like a pokemon go, guys. Or play like, what that game? Dragon. Dragon game, you know guys. Or like a Nintendo services, you know guys. Guess that's what you guys have. You know. You know, I want you guys to meet your own peers. Now, I'm not some grown up man that wants to fuck you as to say, well, I don't want that for you guys. You know everyone. You know. I want you guys to attend the relationship only your show of this person. You know this person sees scripture online. You know it's not Imperial Catholic, if it happens, please confirm me directly as a policy. Now confirm me directly.

Unknown Speaker  18:47  
Build My utopia.

Speaker 1  18:50  
Basically how much your bank account basically five losses on a system online between the losses are equity based principle. You know, if something is not solved, you can solve can see something, but that's put your credit in. So you guys, you know, you know, you put your credit, get money out. But you know, it's like human rights. Give me rights, but you know, give me rights. Avatar rights. Your after is there nonsense? Guys, policy now look November, observer, reform, no, no. So we'll take the wheel to cover yourself. You then take a will the regional Russian, you know, risk of rational framework to reinforcing yourself and getting a good way. You know, get better. Soon, get better. Better. Transcend the system of oppression, depression within cycle of oppression. Sister, and then, you know, we and I build my utopia. Give me utopia, you know, you know, basically I was 1516, years old. That's basically the UK decided to make adults with 16 years old. But milk is fucking missing themselves up with a lot of porn, and they love Kenneth in one years to come, and I just have a license for gun to have a license to a car to a house, you know, the bare minimum. Know, you know, that's what saying Guys, guys, guys, look, if you guys want me to work, you know, I want you guys to understand this onion system. You know properly, you know, try to look at yourself as human being and think about your avatar. Know who you are right now, because you know your children will never be like that. You and your children will be at least be 100% different, you know, when this all comes out, you know. But how would you interpret this out, you know, you know, like, you know, for me, like, you know, basically, you got the concepts in the world, you know, but they're very secretive. So secretive. So we don't have a concert, or anything. We have, like a, you don't have a room or like a place, like a studio. We have, like a we have corn studios. So you have, like, a big space you can perform, you know, in which case I have that I should go order, order. You can compete. The path can be but you know, basically you're gonna have like the compound thing, like, you know, can have a plaza, can have, like, a compound of type A that is like a corn compound. But, you know, the corn compound is like your house, because it's not a house, per se, it's a compound. So you can have a compound because, you know, get one, one master bedroom and two toilets and two toilets, two kitchens. Okay, let's say one big toilet. Basically, we just have one big master bedroom problem. If you have a problem, you guys kind of separate a bit. I don't really care. But one big, one big toilet, restroom. But, you know, you have to be like, you know, very good for human beings and a one, let's say two, two or standard room, you know, just for like, a, okay, let's play rooms, you know, because, you know, I want you guys have a boy and a girl to, like, a look for anything you have, like, you have like, you know, you have a child two rooms separately from they have an extra room for guests like me to become a spiritual monsters, you know, because we can write videos that, you know, no and basically the only very positive should have their minimum, a few of the shelter by minimum. But top of that, for your working and breathing, you should have, like, camera should be there, you know, I don't care. You can, but, you know, one split back home by law, which is a law I should be see these more songs should be nothing there that won't kick out the position automatically. I think after, I don't want to be watching a call when I watching a corner, basically, the basically, you guys, basically, you have to have the property. You cannot have on the ground, basement. You know, can have, like, some kind of a way to show something. But it is called studio. It's like a concept. So the concepts are really there, but it's a studio. So you live there in that compound and work there, because your studio, when you see those making home content, guests, can, I guess, everything, but you have to have, like a two by two acre concert, which has the width of the high location. It's homogeneous. You have like a lifecare and everything there in the process, like a mini concept. The mini one is called One, two square acre concept. Two squared is what four, four square acre focus squared. So two times is four. Us. For the area, and they got the standard three acres. Get three three times. Three is nine. Now that is one big compound. No, it's mini complex. You can have that two or three square guys, good, please don't mess up there, you know. So the thing about this thing, for me, autistic authentication of the thing, basically trapdos Over there. But, you know, they have to be open, you know, that be respectable, very crazy, anything that's like, interpretable, actually go to the table framework, you know, I can tell you something happening, but not see that thing happening, because I'm confused what's happening. The Plaza system, the three corn and you get, like four mini Plaza, the three times with nine, four, that's a mini that's a plaza, a small plaza, or just find a plaza. They got the big plaza which is five squared, 2255, times five, four. So you go, 323, that's compound. And you got a plaza which is four equals four squared, four squared, 16 equals what in the area. Then you got five, five. Square is to the fact, and that's the fact, because what for that many plus, you know, live work, they go or tell me what's the park was, the beaches. You know, this meant to ensure that you could express anything you want socially. You know, I don't really care what you go through. You don't really care how you live. There items, you know, through the research, and they come from a start. You know, you didn't want anybody there compound there, just to see it, you know, just to see what you're doing there. You know, what is the particular I don't want the regulation team. The bail is taking your stuff, you know, Euro stuff, and your house, everything, guys, that's what I mean. You know, you have to live. You know, I don't really want to go to me stuck. But, you know, polling with someone two wives so that one mean two bedrooms, one big muscle bedroom. You know, authentic relationship, authentic infrastructure, you know, represents your soul. If I want to my bed upright, you know, you know, but it's like about authentic infrastructure. These are just you get up, you can work. Get up, you work about working, because just grind into your brain, you know, can be a constituent pets, too, animals. There's very important guys, especially the Cornwall. You know, animals are there, you know, you know, you have to be there for you guys. Um, where did I write it down? I think that's wrongly so when I write it down somewhere here. So seven more minutes. Okay, so basically, basically dog, a catcher on a dog. Basically, these are called kennels. You have a kennel, but the area of a kennel which is a human being going to kennel, but human can be in a kennel too. So basically, I can be with my dog in a kennel if I wanted my kennel, because the kennel is approved for the dog and me. So because she's a hybrid space, me and my dog came to sleep. How's my kennel for my dog? But it's not my dog. So basically, I can have something for my dog. I can have a home for my dog, but my home is my house my dog, which I'm saying to you, same thing. 29 minutes. This is done. 27 let me stop this. Let me just save it. File, Save As export. Audio, wave, kennel, onion, onion one obviously this will not interpret onion, one onion, dot, one onion, one. Video, November the 17th

Unknown Speaker  27:44  
of and they will go there, and

Unknown Speaker  27:48  
this will stop now. 321, okay, let's stop.
