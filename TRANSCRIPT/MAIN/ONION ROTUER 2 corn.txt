This is now recording. Now I set up one more thing, auto AI. Because I don't trust the E.S. or something to use.

One more. Auto AI. Record. 

No. Share. Record. 

No. Okay. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Okay, guys. Guys, you know, I'm going to use some of the terms here. But this video is very important to me and everyone else.

It's a local apps. Basically, for me personally, it means a lot. Because I'm 18 to 5 years old.

I'm like, I'm 24 years old right now. I don't want to child anything. I'm in a room.

I'm going to get a house. But it's going to take time. Because they don't want to help me.

Because I'm autistic and they don't want to help me. I'm just looking at some of them. So, first is first.

Anyone that's not a Gen Z. Basically, you have to be between 1955, oh, to 1985. It's in 1985. Gen Z. I think it's 1912.

Let me calculate it. 2012 minus It's 1987. But 1987 is not Gen Z. Is it? No? No, okay.

I think I'll keep it there. Okay, basically. 1998 plus 25 years.

2012. That's Gen Z. I don't want to keep the definition. If you're born between 1987 and plus 25 years after that, that's my generation, Gen Z. I'm going to put that there.

Basically, I'm going to get a new generation after this. Like Gen Alpha. I know that it's 1997.

1997 to 2012. Not only that, because it's Gen Z. But I had 25 years before. Because I'm 25.

So, this is the point I keep for now. I prefer this one because it's too linear. It's not a lot of people going to be in the acquisition.

Because 2012 is like the end of Gen Z anyway. So, there's a new generation Gen Alpha. It started in 2013.

But, you know, just keep everyone from 2012 to 1987. Just so we can have a Gen Z. You know, and no one else complains in this business ecosystem. Where was I, Nambi? So, today's video is Onion Systems.

Onion Systems. Let me be frank. Onion.

I made this video a long time ago. But, you know, I didn't want to rush it. So, let's do it properly.

Where are you going, Nambi? How much are you going to pay for this system? Are you? How much? No, no, no. Section 2. So, I've got like a pages. I'm just flicking through them.

But I can't find all of them. Because, you know, I just like, I haven't lost them. I just like kind of scattered it in my head.

Because the middle of the thing is not really expanding it. So, basically, how much you are. No, no, no.

That's fine. I got to do it. So onion systems. 

What is an onion system? Basically onion has like many layers to it. But it grows more and more layers. It gets harder. 

We won't get too cold of the onion. Like you know, onion is kind of very good. It's like when you peel an onion layer.

Because there are never any layers of onion skin cells. So basically the root cause of onion is why you do something. I call it the onion initiative. 

So we got the wheel initiative moving forward. Now we got the wheel using the root cover yourself. Now you got the root cover. 

Then you got the root cover of yourself. Because of my lawsuit. And my other one is called Spirit Anchor.

Don't forget anchor your spirit. Why am I doing what I'm doing? My goal is to be a Nigerian, BFR, or constitution, IW, where you live and you work. And what else? Spray masking. 

Instead of masking, instead of lying for just to get back, you lie for a purpose. Not just to get back. Not to get back to achieve an outcome. 

Not just to solve the problem that's there. Everyone can do. But lie to attain more for yourself.

Only for yourself, for the group of people you work with. And the one I'm talking about, you got the pie initiative. 3.145 is a non-ending number. 

Because you can calculate that. And now you got the onion. So basically this pie has onion.

So the onion is like a pie to onion. The real spin, but you know, the core of the onion is like a spin, like a go indefinitely. So the onion has the layers to it. 

So you're going to unpack the layers of the system. Of why it's like oniony. Why it's so like the onion has the smell or the thing.

Because the onion represents like a cone. Like a cone. And we don't understand it. 

Or the internet, you know. Because people have, if you need to go like a root of the full, the rule of cone. Like, you know, root of the full.

You got root of the full. You got root of the nine. Which means like root of the full.

Everything has a cone version of it. So we're human beings. We make it a cone. 

We don't tell anybody. That's why it's taboo. So the taboo is like, you know, we have all the cone in the world.

But we don't, everyone's like, I'm doing cone. But cone is full. Then they say, okay, so basically, that means, basically, there's not a cone.

Basically, on my album, I call something called U34. Which means cone, cone 34. So basically, a universe of cone.

Because the root of the full means like, there's a cone. If there's a cone, if it's a fantasy. If it's real. 

If it exists in a real world. There's a cone of it somewhere on the internet. You know, on the internet.

But you know, that's true of it. You can go to dark web and find it in the cone you want. But I'd rather know you guys go there.

So basically, this is for the onion system. So why do we have that kind of cone? Why do we have that kind of experience? You know, we're human beings. We don't, we have consciousness with everything.

But we don't need to make that kind of cone. Or do we? Or do we? I'm not gonna say shit. I'm not gonna say anything.

Here, Mr. Bean. Let's see hypothetical. Uh, basically.

Basically, this is very, this one, basically, my thing is like, now, I want you guys to do this for me. So basically, this one turns 1 years old. Uh, 2 to 4 onion systems.

GitHub.com has opened this onion. Scene 2? Scene 2, you know me? Uh, yes, yes, no, this is scene 1. No, this is no, this is in 10. This is in 2 here, bam.

This is onion. This is like an open access network. It's like a troll onion.

But you know, the troll onion router system is for the edge gating. So basically, got this, uh, four trans polyglot system for onion indexing. You know, it's about authentic growth.

Um, but it's part of our onion service in the world. It's like a mukou, uh, M-M-U-K, uh, onion. So basically, the goal of this is, um, onion router.

This is like this, uh, onion router. You can run through services, like, you know, authentically, you know. You know, as much as what you're really thinking.

You know. So we run up for speed, but for good heroes. So, basically, basically, the onion system, you know, you pure the onion to understand the intent, uh, state of expression intent, you know.

Especially taboos, and interpretation of taboos. Uh, white things are taboo. You know, things like that.

I feel a magical legend, you know. You see, because, you know, it's about understanding people's actions. You know, when they kill someone, you know.

But, you know, when they, uh, are criminals, you know. You know, it's about gathering this, like, uh, detail. It's basically got, like, a text book's entry, my one.

Uh, basically, it's my onion here. But it's not really framed like that. It goes to repositories.

Uh, uh, repositories go to text books entries. Uh, text book entries, text books. This one here is my onion.

This one's, like, a civil class initiative, like, you know. I'm trying to, uh, um, plug, uh, uh, my order stuff, or, uh, why people are doing, like, they say. But it's, like, uh, my own evidence, everything.

Uh, civil collapse, everything here. Uh, uh, technical development assembly. You know, it's my, uh, strategy board.

You know, I, I look at the accounts, like, and I, uh, why, for you. I just did smart. Uh, but, you know, this is my Hollywood's review.

All the nurses, they say to me, um, decision letter. Uh, for example, I, basically, I can't read this here, because it's, like, uh, it's not as limited. It's just that it's not allowing me.

But it's, like, uh, it's, like, my butt flies on a battlefield. This is my civil column, as opposed to everything. It's, like, my manifesto.

Civil collapse, you know. This is my, uh, personal development framework. So, basically, it's for authentic personal development.

Uh, you know, this is my text book entries. Like, uh, this is, like, a woman I want to see. This is my public.

This is me. Uh, I don't really care about she and myself. I am not scared of anyone.

Uh, okay. So, three or four. If you start at age two or four, you are allowed, uh, onion service up to age seven or eight.

You know, automatically. You know, no one should tell me answers. You know, about it.

It's my business. I'm running. So, basically, when you're three or four, you play FIFA.

Uh, but FIFA cannot preserve you. So, I think I don't want to make it 12 or 13, because you're children. You know, you are... Okay, actually, I just make it 12 or 13, actually.

So, basically, our policy now. Uh, 12 or 13. Three or four.

I'm thinking of it in the real time, because the way I want it is basically, uh, some of the eight games as calendars. You can get both calendars. You can play the host calendars game.

Uh, but 12 or 13 is what, uh, basically, you can stop at 12. Uh, 12, because you're not at 13 yet. Because you can go, like, uh, if I'm three or four years old, uh, I say I want to play calendars.

She would just guess calendars and play it. You know. But if I'm, you know, with a, with a period of guidance, you know, because, you know, the person has to watch me.

Sometimes we observe my state to see whether I'm processing information according to, uh, uh, critics to make sure that I'm placing, like, you know, like a human being. You know, I'm not being, like, uh, it's like a public, uh, anti-popular, you know, control. Because, you know, if an adult, or someone's watching me do something, I do it properly.

You know, which is human nature. You know. Because I'm being observed.

And I know I'm being observed. So that's the problem, you know. If I don't know I'm being observed and I'm being observed, I get a problem.

You know. So it's about guiding my consciousness, my way, my growth. You know.

So, like, uh, so, so basically, everyone in Korea gets to play with your children, uh, on their, uh, mukou, uh, on your assistants. You know. Um, you know, for me, three or four, uh, seven.

So three, four, seven years is complete. Seven years is complete. Seven years is complete.

Eight, uh, 12. Seven, eight, uh, 12, 13, uh, 15 years is complete. Because it's three to go, you know.

Uh, this is the most you can play. Three layers. Beginning, middle, and end to kill.

You know, but, you know, you have to go up, uh, you know, with some peggy, uh, guidance, you know. So, basically, I want to enforce this, you know. The, the, you know, basically, you guys have a game room and everything.

But, this is, this is the onion system in action. So, basically, onion is like, uh, and it shows that, that we are doing this according to how we are meant to do it, you know, uh, based on, uh, uh, watershed. Uh, basically, because the, uh, the 10-9 o'clock watershed, uh, which is, like, you see how like, everything, but, you know, you can bypass that online.

It, it doesn't make any sense. You know, you can go online and get the same thing. But, you know, you don't bypass it.

You know, it's like, uh, you know, the onion is not there. So, the onion services are meant to tell you what is associated with the polyglot. That's the polyglot.

Basically, unless I go to work, uh, sometime I'm going to watch, uh, EastEnders, uh, 8 p.m., uh, I can stay, uh, over, past 8 p.m. I'm a child, you know, just, I don't have to go to sleep or anything. 8 p.m., I can just turn on the TV. Uh, I can just start watching EastEnders and then watch for 30 minutes and then go to sleep.

And then, my mom wouldn't know it. You see, you don't say, my mom wouldn't know I saw WestEnders. That's a big problem for me in my constitution.

You know, because I wasn't too much corny with children like you, you know. So, the thing about this for me is, like, you know, it means, like, you know, I'm very smart. I am not very smart.

Because, you know, my generation behind don't really care. So, I become smarter than them, because they are not actually water my state. Because, you know, naturally, I become smarter than my mom.

I can get anything I want from the internet because, you know, I explore. So, it's like guided exploration, but curated and curated. Your mom encourages you to do it, you know.

Your mom encourages you to do it. Mom, guys, changing moms, guys, guys. You can understand your children, you know.

They're very smart. But naturally, it's not because they're very smart. It's because they have the infrastructure around them and it's very loose.

Like, we as a child, you know. You know, for me, I saw EastEnders. I saw a lot of things on the internet, you know.

And that EastEnders wasn't the only thing I saw. You know, I saw a lot of Malin. Malin was a movie.

It was even part, like, 11, 12 o'clock. What did I saw? I saw, like, a national lottery. What was national lottery? Then I saw the TV shut down on me because, you know, I tried to do some gambling with my phone, my remote on that, what is that, night.

You know, but, you know, the watersheds are not working. They're stupid. You know, governments don't really care about it.

Okay, so basically, three or four, how was that one? It was nine years old. Just, basically, I was nine years old. I was watching EastEnders.

I was watching, oh, Merlin. You know, but the situation on the TV, but funny enough, my mom's screaming against me. She makes me think my brother was in EastEnders' zone and she didn't care.

You know, it's very annoying of that. You know, all those behaviours, those kind of conditions can be annoying. But, you know, you start to get agitated from it.

You start leaving, being left out of the family because you're not following what's happening in the shows. You don't even start doing the shows anymore. So, on your systems, three to four, 78, 12 to 13, 15 to 16, 17 to 18.

But you got 18 to 26, 19 to 20. 20 plus three or four, 20 plus 24 to 26, 25 to plus four, five, six, seven. You just have to count up the increments that, you know, the peggy system counts up to the maximum number.

I think it's 30 because 18 plus 18 is 36. 36, which is going to be the mature. M plus 36 is yours.

You know, by 30, this is yours. Yours goes, oh, guys, you used me to do everything you saw. You know, 36 years old.

Look, anybody that's 36, don't have a house. I swear to God, I don't think you should be in the position. You know, but you've got 25 years to do it.

So, why don't you do it? Don't bother me. Don't bother me. Basically, you see, one more thing.

You have to have equity in the system. Equity, like, full equality. Because, you know, if I'm four years old, I want to buy, like, seven years a game, you know, I want to buy this calendar.

I should just buy this calendar, who I already have. You know, I'd have to pay your money and use this calendar. But if I want to get seven or eight years a game, but if I want to go to 12 or 13, 12 or 13, that's the game I get, 12 or 13.

You know, so I have to get more support. You know, because I'm not even meant to be at that level, you know? You know, but people, you have to do it right. The urbanists are so school will be go up, go up and get the game, 12 or 13.

So, basically, I want people to have 12 or 13, yeah, it says, you know, whether they're three or four, you know, games. You know, it doesn't mean anything. And all games, like, you know, Harry Potter is 12 or 13.

But, you know, daily, oh, hello. You know, like, what's that game? Fast and Furious. The magic one, you know, they're looking at which have a lot of magic and killing people, you know? But, you know, it's like a thick magic.

It's like a magic because it's not real. It's like, you know, you've got like a, like a, what's his name? You know, like, you know. All these games that you see, you can just have a love, like, you know.

But no Call of Duty, funny enough. So, I want people to go down the waiting system, like, you know, go up the waiting system, but, you know, go up, go healing, you know. I want to play a game.

I mess with my friend. I don't get hallucination. I sleep well.

I eat well. You know, you know, and then I, you know, then I say, oh, this is my heart rate as well, you know. I'm not scared of anything in the world.

I know it's a game, you know. I know, I know I can navigate the real world without stabbing someone for GTA 6 or GTA 7 or GTA 6 or GTA 5. That's kind of a bad one. It's terrible.

So, like, the Skylanders thing, the damages, Skylanders, FIFA. Basically, if I'm playing FIFA, I'm three or four. I should be automatically getting a seven or eight.

Now, this is the problem that I just stick with FIFA, you know, you know. But I just like FIFA. I just keep with FIFA.

But everyone should just know the rights to the game and look who's serious. So, that's what I'm saying to you guys. Onion systems are that.

One more thing. Parking, wheel. So, basically, the wheel is your chef.

The wheel keeps moving. You keep moving. Oh, you know.

Basically, you can see 15 or 16. It doesn't mean anything to you guys. Because if you're three years old and once you get to play 18 years old game, you know, I don't really care.

You know, guys are both right there. But the mature rating is, like, kind of the thing. So, I don't know what you guys should do.

You know, I didn't want the guys to take the money to buy a game. You know, I just want the ecosystem to sort out. The credit system, of course, is real money.

Because you're going to work there in your gaming city. You're going to play games. But it's not just about the gaming.

It's about the authentic relationship you have with the people around you. You know, are you speaking to this lady for money? You know, are you trying to hire this person, human rights, because she's an avatar and she's like a, you know, I like her and what she's doing. Are you being authentic? Do you have a shared interest to be around that person? You know, I want you guys to understand that.

For me, I don't speak to a lady, really, online. You know, basically, we want consequence, you know. Guys, you know, guys, you know, don't ever look at someone like that, you know, like, you know.

Look at the avatar of them, but, you know, they, you know, put you, please, please, don't have someone online. I know harassment, you know. It's kind of sickening now.

There's too much. It's too much. You know, you guys are a good man now.

You know, people don't know me when I pay the ticket. Design, or if else, up, down. So, you have to go up the ladder.

You know, you have to have equity, you know. No matter, basically, this is very important. So, for every level, three or four, you get consensus to eight, seven or eight.

But, because this seven or eight can be withdrawn, you know, seven or eight to 12 to... So, because you should, like, consist obviously, you can start, like, a petition for that game. Like, I don't want to play this calendar. It's from three or four.

Like, I don't want to play Mario Kart, which is a seven-year-old game. You know, and then I say that I'm, oh, oh, I don't have Mario Kart. What's the new game is, you know.

I don't have that. We can start a petition. We can get, like, people that want to play Mario Kart for that game.

And, you know, if that game, at least don't get the game for free, you know, but we don't, you know, guys, if you mess this up, you know, and you don't get that game for free, you know, it's going to affect how the world sees you, you know, sees you, and you'll find them. You know, because, you know, this is a simple thing, guys. You work together.

You create something together. You work together. You have a shared mutual agreement.

You get the game, you know. You get the game you have. You want to get, you know.

You play Skylanders. You play any battle royale mode in Skylanders. You get the game, get the membership, get the royalty, the commission, you know.

But you don't go back. You have to go, you know. You don't need to take away Skylanders, you know.

When I put it out one week, when you're doing it, we'll take over the last of us. Guys, you know, guys, this is a gaming system. You know, gaming system needs to be free, fun, enjoyable, and competitive.

You know, when authentic, you know, especially self-authentically, like an avatar, you know. Mooko, the spirit of evil that connects us all, you know. I'm thinking of this for the real world, basically.

So, if you know, like a date for someone in the real world, you know, I want you guys to be able to do it too, but I don't trust you guys, you know. Because, you know, if I'm 7 or 8, and I have hormones over there, I should be able to interact authentically. But if I turn to a teenager 13 years old, I should be automatically with the dating system, you know.

That's what I'm saying to you, because dating is a teenager 12 to 13, it's probably interesting. But, you know, it's just my avatar in real world, like an ID system that connects people in the real world, so you can meet up in the real world place and play, like, a Pokemon Go. Guys, guys, you know.

Or play, like, what's that game, Dragon Game? Dragon Game, you know. Guys, or like a Nintendo services, you know. Guys, guys, that's what you guys should have, you know.

You know, I want you guys to meet your own peers, you know. I'm not like some grown-up ass man that wants to fuck your ass or something, like a Roblox, you know. It messes up your biology, you know.

You know, I don't want that for you guys, you know. Everyone, you know. I want you guys to attend the relationship only on the television, you know.

You're sure of this person, you know this person, you've seen this picture online, you know. It's not computer recording. If anything happens, please confirm me directly.

That's the policy now, confirm me directly. I'm not tricking anyone here. So, you know, I am trying to build my utopia.

Basically, how much do you bank out? Basically, find losses in the system, online. The losses are equity-based, principle, you know. This is something that's not solved.

You can solve, you can see something, you know. But that actually puts your credit in. So, you guys, you know, you put your credit in, you get money out.

But, you know, it's like human rights, like, you know, gaming rights. But, you know, you basically got gaming rights, avatar rights, you know. Your avatar is dead, you know.

No swastika nonsense, guys. I'm not. There's a policy now.

Look. November, observer, phone, no, no, no. You know, that's not what you're going to say.

So, will, you take the will to discover yourself. You then take the will, the original, you know, reticle rationale for you to reinvest in yourself and then build what you, you know. You get better as soon as you get better and better.

We translate the system of oppression into pressure. We end the cycle of oppression into the system. And then, you know, we build my utopia, my gaming utopia, you know.

And, you know, basically, at those 15, 16 years old, that's basically, the UK law is changing. They're trying to make adults who are 16 years old, but America is fucking messing themselves up with a lot of corn and a lot of candy. So, they're trying to make 21 years to become an adult, have a licence for a gun, have a licence for a car, a licence for a house, you know.

There's a bare minimum, you know. That's what I'm saying. Guys, guys, guys.

Yeah, guys, guys. Look, if you guys want me to truly work, you know, I want you guys to understand this on your system, you know, properly, you know. Try to look at yourself as a human being and think about your avatar, you know, who you are right now.

Because, you know, you know, it will never be like that. You and your children will be at least 100% different, you know, when this all comes up, you know. But how would you interact with this child, you know, like, you know.

For me, you know, basically, you got the corn set in the world, you know, but they're very secretive. It's too secretive. Um, no, sorry.

So we don't have a corn set or anything. We have like a... We don't have a room, like a place, like a studio. We have like a corn... We have a corn studio, so you have like a big open space you can perform, you know, in which case I have that.

I should go order all the onion service out there forever. By definition, you can be in the park, can be... But, you know, basically, you got to have like the compound thing. Like, you know, you can have a plaza.

You can have like a compound of type A that is like a corn compound. A corn compound? A corn compound? But, you know, the corn compound is like your house. It's, you know, because it's not a house, per se.

It's a compound. So you can have a compound, because, you know, you get one bath, one master bedroom and two toilets and two toilets with two kitchens. Okay, let's say one big toilet.

Basically, we just have one big master bedroom. You have a problem. You have a problem.

You guys can separate the beds. Like, I don't really care. But one big master bedroom and one big toilet restroom.

But, you know, you have to be like, you know, very good for human beings. And one... And a... Let's say two standard rooms. You know, just for like a... Okay, let's say three rooms.

You know, because, you know, I want you guys to have a boy and a girl. Two... Like, you know, for anything you have. Like, you know, you can have a child.

Two rooms separately. For a man. You can have an extra room for a guest.

Like me. So you can come and expect your nonsense. You know, you guys know, you can write videos there, you know.

You know, and basically, all the various policies there, they should have their minimum. I feel the shout out by minimum. But on top of that, for your working and breathing, you should have like a... A camera should be there.

You know, I don't care whether you can... But, you know, when I expect that cone by low, which is the law. I should be seeing these northones. You know.

You know. I should be not in there that want to kick out of the constitution. Automatically.

I think I have to get it. Yeah, it seems to be doing that. But, you know, I have to figure out what to do.

Which, you know, I don't want to be watching a cone. I don't... I'm tired of it. Basically, the... Basically, you guys... Basically, you have to have the property.

You cannot have underground basements, you know, anything. You know. You can have, like, some kind of a way to show something.

But it's a cone studio. It's like, you know, it's a cone set. So, the cone sets are really there.

But it's a studio. So, you're going to live there in that compound and work there because you're a studio. But your studio is making cone content.

You know. You have to have, like, like a two by two, two-acre cone set. Usually, the width of the height, you know, is homogeneous.

You have, like, a life there. And everything there in the cone set. So, you're going to have, like, a two type of cone set.

Basically, you have one at... Basically, you have, like, a mini cone set. The mini one is called one two-square-acre cone set. Two-square is what? Four-square-acre.

Four-square-squared. So, two times two is four. That's four-acre-squared.

An area. And then you've got the standard three-acre-squared. Three times three is nine.

Now, that is one big cone compound. You know. It's not a mini-complex.

You know. So, like, you know, it's more complex. So, basically, you've got to have that two or three.

That's nine-acre-squared. Guys, guys. Guys, please don't mess up there.

You know. So, the thing about this thing. For me, I just think, you know, I want to be a technical operation of the thing.

Basically, I have, like, sharp doors over there. But, you know, they have to be open. You know.

They have to be inspectable. You know. I don't trust you guys.

I don't trust you guys. You guys are very crazy. At least, you know.

I think that's, like, like, interpretable. As we go through the taboo framework, you know, I can interpret something happening. But I see that thing happening in real time.

Because I'm confused. What's happening there? Guys, I'm not joking. But, you know, I want to thank you guys.

And, you know, the plaza system. Basically, you've got, like, the three corners. And you've got, like, four.

And you've got a mini plaza. The three times three is nine. Four.

You've got 16 equal squares. That's a mini. That's a plaza.

A small plaza. Or just a type of plaza. And you've got the big plaza, which is five squared.

Two to five. Five times four. So, you've got three, two, three.

That's a compound. And you've got a plaza, which is four equal, four squared. Four squared is 16.

And then, that's 16 equal squared. In the area, I think you've got five. Five squared is to the five.

And that's to the five equal squares. Four times a mini plaza. Guys, guys.

Guys. Guys, I meant to work there. You know, live where they go.

Or then, what is the park? What is the beach? It's what, you know, gives me to ensure that you can express anything you want, especially, you know. You know, I don't really care where you go to. I don't really care how you live there.

As long as I don't do it, I don't really get a problem. You know, as long as, you know, it gets nothing, not about for the items. You know, you know, like, basically, you've got a drone, you've got a computer system that comes from the sky.

you don't even want anybody there. They're doing it like that. You know, the thing about this is, you're going to have a compound there, but, you know, you know, you just need to see it.

You know, just need you to see what you're doing there. You know, what does it look like? I don't want the regulation team, you know, the bailiffs taking your stuff, you know, your roof stuff, and your house everything. Guys, guys.

That's what I mean. You know, you just have to live life, you know. I don't really want you guys to be stuck.

But you know, I'm telling you, when someone's two wives, so that one means two bedrooms, one big, massive bedroom, you know. Authentic relationship, authentic infrastructure, you know, represents your soul. Basically, if I want to go to my bed upright, I'm going to put it upright, you know, upright, because I want to sleep upright, and wake up close to my upright wife, because it sounds like a stiletto, and I prefer that for her, because it's like a but it's like about authentic infrastructure.

Things are just, you get up, you go work. You get up, you work. You don't even, like, have to think about it working, because it's just right into your brain, you know.

It's going to be a constitutional attitude, and the more it's there, very important, guys, don't worry about me, especially in the corn world, you know, animals are there, you know, you have to be there, for you guys. When did I write it down? I think I have to start this wrongly. So when did I write it down? I wrote it down somewhere here.

So the corn, oh wait, oh 27. I've got three more minutes. Okay.

So basically, basically, the infrastructure has to have the animals there, you know, because you guys are very funny. So you're going to have like a cat or a dog, a cat and a dog. Basically, these are called kennels.

You can have a kennel, but the area of a kennel is just a human being going in a kennel, but human can be in a kennel too. So basically, I can be with my dog in a kennel if I want to have a kennel, because the kennel is approved for the dog and me, so because it's a hybrid space for me and my dog. I can have a kennel, I have a kennel too, and my house is my kennel for my dog, but it's not my dog.

So basically, I can have something for my dog and I can have a home for my dog, but my home is my house for my dog, which I'm saying to you. It's the same thing. 29 minutes.

Is it done? Let me stop this.
