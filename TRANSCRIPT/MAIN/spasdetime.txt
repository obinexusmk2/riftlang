So basically this is fine. Coding is here. OK, so until it should be apply. I'm like to I've started 3:00 to. 1 yes, basically, guys. Let me stop this video. It's like here, here. Let's start again. OK so basically this video is very important basically for Rift for his parents auto entirely due to Humira is whiskey. This is basically the former called rift he starts calling for. Or via LaGrange Hamiltonian 11. A star vision for fiscal. You know, basically the, oh, we've got everything here. Basically a shimmings video. Claire this day. That's just the idea. Let me get the geek for Geek articles. What is CNN? Cisco certified. Not good. OK, so you got this one. So it's more about the basically it's focused primarily on Cisco. Let me just try to get it here. Bricklin tried to declare the skies once again. I'm going to do this medium here. I'm going to go here, I'm going to change this. I'm going to move the sights, remove the sights one second. I wanna add a site. But I've got all my notes here so she'll be fine if I don't get this video today. Should be enough. Should be. It's like it's just one of it. So this is Cisco now. This is a Cisco. Cisco is just. Go to Cisco and Risko. So I'm looking for the risk of 1. So basically you got Cisco instructions risk risk. So you get this one basically. Assembly, assembly. So basically it sounds very complex, but we have to go through this speed by a bit via. So basically you go to risk, risk and CICK, which is the foundation of everything I'm doing here today. So you guys should try to. If you don't really understand anything, just. Yeah, and I tell you guys, you know, 'cause it's Utah knowledge, you have to. So if you try to, if you don't start anything here, you have to at least go away with one thing. One thing I don't want in this framework is it's all architecture. I'm trying to build the Rift architecture, yeah. Uh, so how do I start this? This is the URL here. So this is like a a so this is a a full screen slot the the dimensions of that. And now I flip it. I got the rotation today. So I got what I want you to go staff for sport digital modeling. But this way of this we have we have to. A stunt once so you know really architecture anything this would you see the same thing since complex instruction set and we got oh pie a pie got you you got rich and sis but you know simple. Installation we got a complex so basically we use both. So we got a controller program memory, UC program, memory controller, data planner. But these are two the same system. These are the same systems, but we have both of them in the rest. So because it's really bound to research 3 Rift 3. Coding of newly epsilon, which is your epsilon which I don't know, or negative my and then my epsilon is my epsilon. I don't know what. We're not sure we are the consistent model. So without further ado, let me send you this you to the applications of this because I don't want to boy with the maths, I don't buy you the pin I can just give you because let me just show you what's going to show you how I want to show you, you know, because it's new, so you get it quickly. So. Basically the problem is this, this is Simon this year. So basically it's not even this so good site here. So basically so you have a downloading here during this site here I'm literally trying to draw this offset but I'm trying to use a reverse stream. So basically. A reverse stream. So basically it's you got you got standard duplex stream. You can send something in, you know, send something in and then you can reply to it. Send let me give the cream. Let me give you the metrics for this. Let me give you the matrix because I don't know. Breaks the system, break your brain. Just give you the concern. So got this data here. Here. So. So if I can send, if I can send, I can see, I can receive that idea. If I can send it to, you know, I can see the bad direction. It's bad direction you get yourself. So the model is. So I send, I send some chocolate data. I can basically you can use the core system. So look at this like I don't give you the whole thing, but it's like a the model. So this is called a way she goes something called a Risco quail or you got a Cisco coil. So the triplets package system. So they work in the. They work in DS Simmons in priority distances. So no, it's not really a part you can talk or you're on the wrong or right. It's more that service on flexible. From the date of 2000 and 2010 when I was nine years old. Obviously when I keep this country, I was in 2010, the 1st of January 2010 to FPGA date, which is basically downloading the segment. 225 is presented today is 11th of December. So let's do it for three more years. So if I do it, if I'm 15 years plus 15 years would be plus enough for Bitly to 2050, 'cause you know, that's another year of social care to see how the water changes. I don't even care about the concept, but you know, how do you download something for free today? That kind of I'm giving us, let me give you the model of it. So you see this here, This is what I'm saying it's here. So you see this here. So this is the mother. She gets the ring. Let's go to here. But you get very badly on this. You get she's going to see something I can so basically that basically when this is updated. You know, you can download the object, you know, but just by listening to it, by observing the only the state of the program. That's idea. It's like futuristic because you don't need to know the state you're in. You know to of the program at the moment that together just make the primary basic basically you really the system is really downloader. So basically when you have a when you. Something what is it what's the update you send it it's it comes from but you know, many of this was it's it's about him. We want to learn something breaks. You have to download the set and then rollback. So that's idea is basically you rollback, you don't do any more maintenance of maintenance. So but he wants you to something, we update it and we update something. You send it, you can you send it again for the update. So that's the quality. So, so simply here, so we go the model here. So my model is different. So when we upload it, it seems as downloading it because just it's a source of authority. So just like you know, if I'm downloading it, if I'm updating it, I'm already live. So if I'm downloading this, I'm basically if I'm updating it, I don't update it. I need an updater if I'm downloading. If I'm live, I'm using it and I'm actually I'm the one using it. I'm actively using it, but you know, that's kind of season break. So so one thing to you, you can model this as a steam machine. So can you D and. Life like, you know, remote life like, you know, like an active session. Active, let's call it UDA for active. AUD you know, so this like a just a it's like a if you get this one updated, sorry, oh, sorry, downloaded updated DU get DU. I'm going to get a UAUAI think actually. Still still still. So you get a sorry listen. A. A ADNA. So it's going to stick to text. Obviously you get the even downloading the servers updating from downloaded. If I'm updating, this is good to you. If I'm actively using it again, do you you, if I get AU get to you, you get. You you didn't get a AP UB and get a DAD. DAED. To AT and get a. DU oh you D again you 2 and you get UA and you get a UA and you get. To AC2A then a two OK then please. So basically just i'm gonna hear since I'm saying you get a simple structure here. Basically, if this is a model you need basically it's a model book because you know there's some kind of model there, but the table, so it's basically minimalize when you're done something someone else is. Nail pointer, Oh excellent state Tripos Excellency you have to preserve at all times in case of active use, you know of activities. So basically it never breaks the model sound because the digital structure doesn't have some way to solve 3 people dilemma. So basically it's the agree agree. Let's OK, let's all you get two people to do it. You get let's agree to disagree. So if two people agree, agree. If I if I agree with someone, basically my person agreement if I agree with someone is their degree. So one is agree I'm. When i speak with someone when am i hey, I am disagreeing. Ibrahim wanted to. Then we just so when I agree. A A a discipline to get disliked A a doing a circle. So I can't affect her here. So again when I agree. We disagree, I agree, agree. I agree. And this is like a We disagree. Never agree. No, no. So this is no, no, no. So this is this like a metaphoric so. So same thing here. It's very important because you know, I'm going to optimize the time at all one school via recently I'm going to quit a Lawrence attractor functor. Make sure that you know you're paying for time. So I'm going to update. Of the problem before the business he knows how to do of this restructured basically zook ahead and download the simpler one secure done done. So you get that on 2nd. So when I. So we haven't, we haven't actually we haven't access here. So when I agree, someone agrees. So you get a state machine of of a show states. A If I, if I, if I agree, and then if I agree and so on. Disagrees and the last person is not sure. Oh, that's the worst case, No. So you get Dimitris Adun. ADNADN, this is the worst case scenario, the Tripoli, this is like there's no consensus. No, there's no consensus. You get to try the epsilon, epsilon, epsilon. There's no agreement. There's no moving forward. There's no new structure in the day off, you know, so it's computable via dimensions. So this matrix is just one model of it. Or if I transpose this matrix, it's I get the identity, it can be supposed to pop here. So you get something there you have to use here. So this matrix or here, that's what I'm saying, see. ADN ADN ADN. But this week see that's like I said, it's busy. I agree, you agree, but it's my it's agreed. But that's mostly you. I agree and you agree, but my agree is your disagree. So I get the. Input disagree indeed. So you say A but I say you see the instant medi and when you send me DI get the and I I have to change my next A to take in D Now I know you say D but what did you mean? Do you mean D is? And this seems to work. So I get consented. Try again. So I now send you the DD and you now send me a. Now we get a in my way. I see you might want ICD. 88 for my ACD and then you want to see A from A you see, from D from D you see AD. So basically why is he agreed to me, you see? When I see this agree and then I agree, you see D, you start from D and you go A&D. So you see agree. Then you see disagree. This same thing disagree, you don't agree. So this is the state, uh, of technicality clinically. So when you see DANICDA, we agree on DA, uh, uh, DA, uh, something that's, uh, easy to weapon. Uh, so we have a new state, umm, which is, uh, a shuttle state, you know, something we now know, uh, a shuttle state, uh, we should go new state is basically a computer state, so. Migraine and mice degree. So we get the migraine. Migraine is your degree and your disagree is my degree. So this is the my degree. And you know, I can't make any day when you give me a day, I get a so I didn't get a so get the A and then it is AD times A is DADADA. To get the items at 880 + 80. So they get DAADA, 'cause you know we both we should get if you agree. If you agree, I agree, send, send, agree, send a I get the. I to get a switch to a thing and I send you team and then you see a so a so you get I send you DI, send you A, you get DA and then you send me D you get AED. So basically what you're saying is what you see. So this is what so if I get ADH and AD? 2-DA has to do like a one time. DA, I sent you 1D and then you know, one time, then I get the two times today. But D stands for disagree. So I sent you 21 agree. I sent you 111 agree one or two agrees and that's 2DS2. Times 2DS2 motors away SO2AD is that this is going to see get this done so if I send you an A basically in a tripod model, we get 3 models of this you get I'm going to turn in Easter as you get. A a a literally get all the states. It's not steamer lane is you get For the homestead community, can we have threesome story? We have 3 square 3 cube states of eight. So we get 9 total is we get. And they'll get D queued. I'll get. 9 entities and then we get to get a cube D cube and. Nil nil acute which is 90. So we get a state of 910 + 9 = 27 configurations configurations or Hamiltonian and Eulerian. A sport positive here is the scoring a star school. So this video is just to get 9 + 9 is the 19 and then 19 plus the 9:27. Homophonic revisions, which at least are bound to the model which is structure the districts are using to resolve. Agreement for consensus first of all, so you can have a similar model. So you have 9 + 9. So this So if we so so when I agree here, just the first video. So when I agree, there's a this past sensuality of so when I agree, when I when I agree. You disagree and we we don't agree. So when I agree, when I agree, you especially when I agree, you disagree. Are you me? Are you So when I agree? So when I agree When I put an A? When I put an AAI mean a UCD. When I see a, when you see the, I see an A. And this is not sure. So when you see an A. Uh, why is he a? Do you wanna see a A and AD? I don't know what that means, but so I see AD. But you will not see AD you not see. AE and an east. So the epsilon state is like the last thing you consider you of my source. You get the, you get. So for me, this means that you know when I see, when I observe a state of. A agreement in my world. If I say dad. AD epsilon or on shore or unsure, let's say if I'm sure Adu so my wanna be Adu. But you know, for me to see that one, I'll be seeing the I know I'll be seeing I'll be measuring the AEU the so that's the priority. OK, So what is called polarity? So DAU is someone else epsilon state where U is unsurety. So if I see A and I want to see one of the show, I have to definitely on a functor the maps to the associates again. ADUDAU&A. EU and A. And and the AE so, so da you know, da you know. So this is the. No way. So basically when you disagree, when when I disagree. So it when when I agree and disagree, then that's that means that the person in the passage agree makes an agreement. So we have to put an A. But he's in an excellent state. So he's an E. So AD is surety. So here's the show. So he's give me his own A. And it'll be he's gonna be unsure and that would be his unsure. So I'll be excellent. So he gives more salon 'cause he doesn't know what that is, but he's just like women 'cause we know the agreement is EU, so he gives his own EU. So I'll be you, you, you, and that's be his one, so. DAU and UAD so he's gonna be UAD. So when he's in show, we agree, you know we all agree. So we have to get everyone on this because you know this one said so when he's on show, we love it. So every problem here guys, you can see this. This is matrices you get like a sparsity of it. So so my one again will be. Will be me. Me will be equal to me. AAE. Is my AD, This is my. This is my vector. But this is me. Oh stop, stop, stop. I'm going to be uADUAD so but you just securely discuss a negative so I see Adu. So this listing you have to go through the state of Adu first. What is like a the the vector alignment, I can go through the input as a vector AED or go through at the Edu or DAU or you know. We are where I start with the point I start EDUUD such as a you know what I'm saying? So it's not really a bad thing 'cause I'm. Is it best to call you Seagate is not really on Claire, Should I say to you it is really on. Let's not forget you. So basically is this scene something daily If they see my obviously if you sleep once you say my worthy if I see an A that means. There's 2DS I have to go to 2DS, but that 2DS means that someone else is a the 2DS and then what year you So I see two days and W2 state you you to to you. Oh, to to you, to you. SO2A2U2U22U. SO 2A2U. And then 2D. All right, so a see for us allergy a star. A star. Uh, to you to do the to the to you and then 2D. Uh, from DI go to DD and I do. A2A2A. A2 ER and from 2:00 AI get U. To you and I get 1D. So this is a rafter root, right? So this is like a one more. This is my Risko model. So so basically it's really consensus was competitional. So basically when we all agree, we have these three model, so there's two. To you 2D on the left, 2U on the right and three U 2A. And then to you on the ball and then get the one under note. So you get left, left, left root right and from use like a Briscoe. Basically, this is a what's called Bucknell phone, which is the standard no matter you do bottom of top down puzzle, But this is the format I'm. So basically this is a risk model. Now let me give you the other one, which is the Cisco model before I start the server and then we'll do Cisco here. I got people, a lot of people here not so let me give you the two more side by side. So you get let's go position. This one is a A to the to you, to A to you and then D This is a riskco risko. Basically this was a difficulty the pocket with good data. Or message or dot GSM files that's a view consensus and then the the signal will be if I agree we have to start from also get the other one. So if we ask that we can. At least the risk of. Is this either it? ADUA to D So this is a column one what's called column column no. A row, Mr. Mr. Rowe. I'm just a conjugate congregate conjugate, which is a color. The column will get a. Row and the column again if I want to get to that, go to D. The the column one dig deep. They need to. 228 So again, 2A and 12A and D. Here. So this is now the column one. Cool monster. This was cool. This is Cisco. No, Cisco is more concise, but you know, it's basically the best one. We have got this kind of cool 1. So you see this one is like sister. So the represent states that consists of bucket. So you get a a, a is which and you get the 2A1 and then 1D and then you get already. Basically you get it's Columba, it's not symmetric so you have the metrics number when I have to make this a DU? The Matrix DEA. I'm so submitted a UUD. Columns. And then again ADADUDAUNAUAD. So this new game, uh, was it, uh, but you know, how is downloading the via previously, you're trying to get a system to original state of the system, uh, based on, uh, some unknown update. So we don't know how to do this itself. Uh, both in that kind of channel collection, we, we, we use some kind of information on how we. To update the. So the goal of this lead to calculate everything. But you know, that's the simple thing we shouldn't give you. So after that initially tell you now I'm done with this paper now. So this is the whole thing I've done today. This music is off right now, this thing. Basically it's a kind of thing so so this is the excellent transition state. So basically I'm going to find a Cisco Center for. The other consciousness system, because you know, it's consensus bound is not meant to, for me anything this short topology ensure it works as needed. But you know, I've really got to work with them here. So I'm just get to it. Let me see if I can find it. I don't really know. Oh yes yes so this works so this is what version here. So let me just, I'm going to make the video after this I'm going to show you. So this gives them, yeah. So so basically you have a a transition. Obviously I'm talking about packet structure. For the model that's kind of cool V intuition. It is really I'm trying to what some what to what's up try tag resolver. So basically web assembly is similar for web and you get what? Wasn't, wasn't it took So what was somebody you know what was somebody with you? I'm trying to quit the rift ecosystem for missing especially St. say 000 is the new encoding for state for organization. Bring one, bring Rift one-on-one or state one is the passage. We have to polarize. So rift 2 is not rift 3 is the assembly. I'm an assembly year of two. I have to go to 3 is the bacon player, which is the watermelon assembly, but you know stuff out of two. So that's I did it. So basically this is just a recipe question during here. So basically good everything here I'd have to work anything out behind so. Go through it because I don't bore myself. So so say you switched. I'm trying to go from say so goes to go to alphabets and ZA the recordings and the kind of thing you get there is so definite, JoJo. Epsilon. So let's go, uh, letters, uh, are not uh, uh, it's just the realistical modeling and, uh, physical modeling. But you know, epsilon states are the universal state. Everything is something excellent state doesn't know status for nothing and everything. So it's kind of something there. So it's Epstein logical. Because it's a, it's a normal thing business day. So reserve memory. Basically you have ref token. So you have a self token with value reverse memory, which I'm saying 'cause you know, you have something that has to be resolved for some competition. So it's like a fluid system. It's fluid that's idea. So roof is flexible because you have. So if I have a 5 ^3, a five cube, 5 * 5 * 5 dimension, 5I only need 5 ^2. I don't need to talk about the volume, then the volume will be used for something else when it comes something doesn't there's a place order of that kind of thing? So basically use this. So let me walk through a competition now. So you get the. So basically this one doesn't here. Do you see this you know basically it's like a lancone series of it so you so basically this one is actually important for States and this one's called the state CBSE is quantum bound, but it works on quantum principles on classic systems, but it's usually there's the currency and it wasn't fundamental systems, but you know it does the same thing the best it can in classic system basically is a similar code. Le Grant transformation busy is like a lattice bound transmission. This is standard cone system in computation. This you get the quartile state, the two state due to state of a system. He knows, he doesn't know he does. He knows this is I want, especially if he's like in those constraints, like in those two states, it's constant topology is 2 and one in those two states, two information at once and then he, you know, and he got another one. He doesn't know, you know, if you know something else, you know if you got that system, he knows quadruple into the power of 2. So you get the NQ and factorial or this is 2 to the power factor. So he knows those two states. I want to say it's not really a problem for so you know, all three states are 1, so it's empower. So you don't really know if you know. I, I'm gonna stop, make it simple for you guys. It's, it's a problem to do, but I don't think about what's related now because I'm trying to sleep. For example, we get the state A, you know the state B&L. If you know the state L, you know the state E&B. Why? So basically this is the quoting system. So imagine you're trying to go through. So basically here, so this is the system. So this was the Paris lot of business. I'm trying to use them the loan gamma factor basically if you have the rough shift, rough shift is like, you know things of this are from move away from us. Obviously for, you know, the birth person and it comes with her and it becomes more noisy. But in Russia, if there's a phenomenon of time, space-time, about the space-time, so the space overtime auxiliary function. If i than some other universe is seen opposite right? The opposite color of it. Who's exactly a green live? No red, blue opposite of red. Opposite of red of. Of red so so the the the the the sorry red. A set by color red, so basically the opposite of red is what's. Oh sorry, red is yellow. Red color opposite of red. The opposite of sorry, the opposite of red is. Sorry, the opposite of red is. Be yellow. So basically basically it's a dilemma because it works on some kind of quantum principles. So something in red would that mean something's getting closer if you're from the universe? That's what I mean. You know something's going close to making so that I can basically you get a, you know you. Sometimes away a Big Bang, you get a big crunch, you know, So it's what it is. You are you are the time is inverse. Can you get invest? I'm not saying this is something basically that's the formula here. The big cruncher, obviously we've seen that the US is spending then you get something shrinking, but everything is about to implode. So you get some kind of something new after the implosion. So when something implodes and can't even implode, he has a half a size half is dimension and then explode. Also busy in this in this universe for you know, for the. Upload your you came into implode but it's your time is reversed so you don't explode in time. You implode before you go to another medium. You're trying to shrink your medium and there's a scale by the old also which is your status for the your 40 dimension but you go to get a half your state done. 4 dimensional B and then you have to impose a 4 * 2 so you get is K by two, so 4 * 2 you get 2 we can do so you get half dimension and it's cared for. 4 ^2 is 16 C You're now at the 16 dimension dimension because you are half the time. You know you're not busy if you go 3/3. This is 1.5 D 1.5. You have half included into you now international now 3 * 2 three squared is 99 now in the 9th dimension. Now you now have demand dimension of action 9. That's the same thing. So you keep your state. So basically same thing you get EXO. Or three. Or three. Or three. Three or three. If you if you are, if you XYZ get the XYZ code system XYZ, it will just be active. You get 3 dimension three or three or three dimension if it's there equals 9 dimension 90. 90 'cause you know 3 * 3 it's three O 3 It's easy, you get three O 3 so you get 1/3 dimension, but then you get exclusive to other three, which is. Which is. One dimension of this process space. So obviously this is the observation this one dimension or based on direct, so you don't need to anymore input Excel or C not gates. So you don't need anything, you can go in space and time. But you know, we don't distinctly preserve remember you can go to any universal information. So the idea of this LeBron transform, it's a little more modernist Lawrence transformer from reverse polling. So basically the idea is just that you measure for in all time, so. But it's not complete because it is not for the inverse time. So the change in the time of change which is but the reduce is the space of space-time. So the conjugate 1 is one of our this thing. I'm going to school. I've been abroad. I don't know. I don't know, but you know, but I just know the. This is the reciprocal, so V is also right. V is the time, B is ratio of V to C Time is called speech, but the idea is you have the Lawrence factor. Uh, uh, so in two mode, so in two mode. So if I'm in space, I have a major for time. I, I can't observe my time. Uh, so I have to give time and dementia. So time has 2 dimensions. He has the conjugate form. Uh, we should measure the 1:00 we, we don't measure for. Time, but you know, it's the example this space-time, I mean space right now I know the times ticking, but I don't I can't affect see the effect of the time ticket. I know time is there. Another substitute in time, so you can do, but I don't can't measure time as accurately if I have one unit of information, so that uniform is just working without being taken without. Just being aware in my space, type continued. But you know, there's something I can do to systematically get a system to measure it. So you can do this in proper ways. So space over time. So basically Myspace of three DI get commercial time, time the time is a commercial. So if I do some algorithm space, some semantic memory, Felician memory, like you know, let's say a KB 2. Two petabytes? No. No, 2000. No. Let's say two 200 megabytes. 200 megabytes. Megabytes is what? MB? Which one? One KB is 1K sun. You get 2 terabytes, which is a quantum state. One KB is 1000. To 100,000 to get. 100,000. In one MB. Now 1 megabyte is 100,000 so. So you get to, let's see, I want a 200 megabytes of space switches, 200 megabytes because it's double, which is 2000 megabytes. Now this MB is no KB. So I get that and I do some competition. Space-time, basically you have to measure for the time. You couldn't get time, which is time I, I don't really account for, you know, I need, you know, 'cause you know what, I need that time to say 1 of the time. So the time. A commonly used Easter school, yeah, because, you know, Easter school can monitor the structure. But the summer something that time has to take you soon. 2000 megabytes. 200,000 megabytes. Of time the space is. No, it's not. It's not good enough for the time 'cause you notice that this problem is timeout and they will never continue. So you can get it probably. So get 200 megabytes, so get 200 / 2. 200,000. 1200. Thousand 200000123. Divided by 1015 kilobytes 15 the time is university. Usually if I have 100 and time to open scale, you know you will break because the zoom have a district. So you're trying to have an the function trace the system states in return. So if you have the time now the time linear, you have the this lowest factor you can measure your time. All time with his model of time. Basically we can measure, we can have this 10:00 we take. The one we measure ahead of time to see the login. But this or one could have to be too. So the old 01's calling has to be listened to. Our own author is an item we we can't account for. Such a yellow shift or yellow shift is what we want to measure for. So yellow just means time they have. They have time, they have what we can't see, we can't account for, but we can act on it. We have to take a measure basically anytime we have here. Half here in our world is half the time because in the full picture we have half the time of the recently we have half of the time full dimension of time. So we so example all the XYZ 3 dimensions we have and we have a dimension time which is optimal time. Basically we try to make time the subject so time is the subject so. Obviously if you want to get the full full time, your problem will download or some basic some yellow shirt. Just to think of yellow shift, yellow shift that contains moving away, moving away, moving away and imploding us in half time in login and that login of space and time. Will be a now log N or space and time which is innocent space-time consumer and that will literally be used to compute of O1 for downloading the future things that are being updated without maintenance. So I go to the store now, but the idea is literally to use the conjugate model of Laurent transformation to via. This is NLM Atlas. This is the same thing. This is the Library museum but in civil language model which is 1 to do. This is some kind of This is the console I just explained to you of time to give you the the time as we know it here. So and then at this time is what? So this is a NLM. So this NLM is here. So it's belonging model and we get the. So we get the NLM framework here. So this one thing you can see them. Let me show you this picture here. So you get the the time here. So. My XYZ is there ZXY so. YZX, you know this is how he but his idea here, if you look at this property, I'm saying here, so this is basically measuring their time with our instrument because our time which is time with halftime, so a long end time. Because, you know, we don't have the full time dimensions there. So every dimension in our world, what is X? We don't go back in time because time is before watching for time. But they move backwards in their own time, basically in their own time. We're moving backwards to we're moving forward too. But you know. But the Infinity we we name you before we we we can't see the weather today because you want state of become much of what is seen everything. But we can measure obviously if we are obviously if we have a hard time if they can only see half our time. Half our time, which is the full time we have, uh, for 3D, uh, 3D work, uh, because you need work there to the universe. There's, umm, there's a full time. They have half the time too. We can see half of that to make one time. So if you measure this 1/2 and half, we get half plus half equals 1. So for that to condition Rs is 3 dimensional instruments. We can take scientific time over the human process. So that's idea. So you get XYZ so future tech. Excellent excellent what is this actually get in the xY and Z and this is the future tech area. This is the come after this idea. So this is just an LM address unless you know let me post it now. So basically the bank is gonna work on this bank confidence after the next video, but I'm trying to make 3 videos today. This instruction get a decoder in the next video. So this video I'm going to just stop now anything just ask me but you know, thank you guys for watching.
