um today um uh I want to introduce you guys to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.240
the writer's framework or historical council. Uh&nbsp;
basically this is the aura seal. Uh first of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.880
this is the aura seal. See this image this ebook&nbsp;
pattern 3. Uh this called an aura seal. So it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.360
basically um the the thing I've been talking&nbsp;
about. Uh but it's basically like a drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.800
uh for patterns everything. Uh now we got&nbsp;
this one. Basically this this is about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.480
writers framework in my heart. This is like&nbsp;
um this land is all mine. this scribbling. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.960
but this is what I've been practicing um on my&nbsp;
art book. Uh, some of them I didn't really do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.840
but I'm going to show you guys. This is&nbsp;
really fun for you guys to see cuz I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.560
really good at it. Uh, but I'm not really&nbsp;
that good at it. Just trying to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.560
um uh basically this is me practicing. Uh, so you&nbsp;
got here um something. So you got like stage one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.080
to stage one to uh it's about form. This is&nbsp;
the last stage. The box falling the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.160
Uh so you got like uh stage one uh uh&nbsp;
circle perfect uh faces ovals slinky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.480
uh and then we got like cub boy the deform shape&nbsp;
and then uh an atomy part and and some folk

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.000
notes to me. Uh this is lollipop girl. Basically&nbsp;
it's a really beautiful girl. Uh but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.400
she's kind of so beautiful that she's dangerous&nbsp;
cuz everyone might want her but no woman commo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.440
she's um she's a hoe the the four three and a b&nbsp;
you take a 43 uh and you write upside down flip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.960
upside down that's what that is um but you know&nbsp;
this is this like antichrist uh uh antichrist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:44.320
Japanese home this for zod uh you can find this&nbsp;
on medium.com but you know Um the story if goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:51.520
uh Zia is S uh X I A on space regret devil's&nbsp;
deal. Uh this is very important for me. This like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.680
uh the story about Zia a devil worshipper. She has&nbsp;
everything but she wants more power. She wants um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.400
uh universal power. She wants to able to like go&nbsp;
into the demon realm and do stuff to the demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.280
But you know she starts to power and her dad&nbsp;
mama king. They're monarchs. Uh they're Chinese&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.520
um and Japanese. uh but not Chinese because that's&nbsp;
Chinese history. So you know Japanese and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.040
want um Jia is very rich but she's very agreed&nbsp;
with power. She wants to be the the most powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.440
person in the world because you don't think mom&nbsp;
and dad are doing well with the power making&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.560
everything normal good for everyone just she's&nbsp;
evil basically I love basically I love evil evil&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.960
stuff. Uh this one is um uh this is incibility.&nbsp;
So basically this for like um the I still got it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.760
inspired by the people. So basically this means&nbsp;
king and this goes down. See this king uh that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.360
king. The cross is like the um uh king or child&nbsp;
to become a king. Child adult in king. So this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.200
like see this one. So basically this means child&nbsp;
to adult to king cuz I'm a n king cuz my dad want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.520
to crown me. But I'm a real king for real guys.&nbsp;
I'm not joking to you. Just my dad is useless. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.880
um so this is the one. Uh so this is like a proep&nbsp;
here. This is a king. But it's like a pattern for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.760
it. So this one's king. This one's going back to&nbsp;
the country. this like a sibly um so this about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.280
like iconography but about the really icons but&nbsp;
all are symbols but symbols are just etchings so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.920
there's a relationship you know so like I can just&nbsp;
draw a symbol um but a symbol won't mean anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.400
it's just an etch I can just draw but you the go&nbsp;
giving me making me something so referral system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.800
matching time uh then we got um this uh thing&nbsp;
here oh basically I wanted wings so I myself wings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.720
So this wing basically but this like one wing type&nbsp;
it's like if I spread it out but this is for like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.200
actually um this is called um this was actually&nbsp;
for something called um another basically this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:51.280
art was called um what's the article piece called&nbsp;
uh this RP was called um wingman. So basically you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:58.960
see this wing this wing is like a resition of like&nbsp;
someone that's really OP uh you know in in CQB&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.760
uh close quarters combat. So see if you know&nbsp;
CQB you know there's a song called a wingman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.520
and that person also uh the corner so it's like&nbsp;
corner slicer but you know that person has a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.280
important job and that's to kill um uh your eye to&nbsp;
side cuz we can turn 180 180 but that's not enough&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.600
uh when you are in close combat it's like&nbsp;
it's narrow it's like it's too much to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.160
it's like you know and the wingman is just um&nbsp;
your field of view over uh 180° uh but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.320
you are basically looking straight you uh not&nbsp;
straight, but you're looking like in between 180&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:41.200
uh 90° um uh but you don't really cover the&nbsp;
whole um uh let's say 125 uh 90 to 125 degrees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.720
but you don't cover everything cuz you don't. So&nbsp;
the wingman cover the rest cuz you know they'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.840
get a gun and they go by your side and it's&nbsp;
like a tag team. So basically they they clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.080
out the the hard corners like you know uh for&nbsp;
example this is a basically say someone um in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.960
that like say this like this is a corner here.&nbsp;
This is corner here. Let me just show you guys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.920
See this corner. So there's four walls here.&nbsp;
Uh one corner here, one corner here. My bed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:14.000
is another corner here. See that corner? Uh four&nbsp;
walls, you know. Uh now one left and so basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.920
uh if I want to go from here um I position what&nbsp;
I mean uh into that door uh into that door there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.000
uh uh this corner. I cut this I go to this corner&nbsp;
here. This corner here uh and then I say okay now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.480
I slice. Now this is now this person is like uh uh&nbsp;
that corner there is like the entrance like the is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.680
like someone going in. So basically cuz I'm going&nbsp;
out I want to go out. I I then turn and shoot. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.160
but the wingman's job is to make sure that all&nbsp;
my other angles are covered you know cuz I can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.920
shoot there and he can shoot me and I die. But&nbsp;
the wingman can like um pick this corner here.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.320
So I don't have to I keep going straight. You know&nbsp;
it's kind of weird but you know I just keep going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.720
where I want to go. That's called a point man. So&nbsp;
you got a wingman and a point man. Uh this like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:08.400
wing wingman. Uh the winged man. The wingman. Uh&nbsp;
the wingman is a drawing. Uh and this like a a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.000
giraffe. This is draft. I don't know what I call&nbsp;
this like a a bird. No, no. This called a freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:24.560
bird. Draft one. I call it freedom board. Uh&nbsp;
this is a freedom bird one. Uh, and this is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.520
uh the wing. I need a wing uh span. Like you know,&nbsp;
I'm actually trying to lift the wing. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.640
it's like a wing or trying to lift it. It's like&nbsp;
I'm lifting the wing. You see this? What I should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.720
be doing? Like I should be lifting the wig. Uh&nbsp;
this like um some lady some man lady. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.800
me. This is a very dood. But um I'm going to get&nbsp;
back to it. One second. One second. Let me just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.080
come back to it right now. Uh before I just make&nbsp;
a video now. I'll make a video later about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.200
artwork. But uh and this is Ezami. This is King&nbsp;
Nambi because this like I'm a king in Nigeria.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.920

my YouTube channel. Uh but you know the avatar is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:03.520
going to be there forever. Basically Nambi is&nbsp;
gonna be talking to Ezi Nambi. So basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:09.680
this is Nambdi. No this Nambdi meaning king in&nbsp;
my country. So he's a king. He's wearing an EO&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:17.200
crown almost everything. Uh and then this is um&nbsp;

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.360
a symbolic meaning. You got a three feathers.&nbsp;
Basically, a chief has two feathers. He has three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:38.000
feathers for uch e and me obi. So, it's kind of&nbsp;

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.200
go to you guys. So I do it to myself. So basically&nbsp;
um and this my uh can board uh that's not double&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.040

keep saying writer's framework but you know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.040
writer's framework is this anyway so basically&nbsp;
got a doodle uh which is just a do question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.280
that doesn't mean anything basically got level&nbsp;
zero this is level zero this a child's drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.400
uh you got this catch uh this sketching like level&nbsp;
one like the sketch you know the the form uh you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:38.400
given to some object form you know and you got the&nbsp;
authentic pressure like um is he me is he no he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:44.080
got the no I got I expression. Okay. Basically,&nbsp;
you got the authentic expression. Yeah. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.880
this level two like authentic expression in the in&nbsp;
the biome where you are like who you are, what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:55.680
expressing. Uh this uh this like uh symbol like&nbsp;
then you got um basically you got level zero which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:01.840
is a do you can do anything. Level two one is&nbsp;
catch. Uh level two is what authentic expression&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:07.040
want to express like um like someone falling,&nbsp;
someone dying, sanders emotion. Uh mine was based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.640
on verb noun verb noun pairs like you know uh the&nbsp;
verb noun concept modeling that uh puts into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:19.040
uh 3x3 um like you know uh uh like the golden&nbsp;
ratio proportions everything how how that depicts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.440
the what the emotion I want to give what I want to&nbsp;
show to people about uh whatever I'm depicting uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.120
then you got uh authentic uh craftsmanship soaric&nbsp;
or cultural expression so it doesn't have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:38.480
cultural can be symbolic can mean to you mean&nbsp;
to you and you got um authentic craftsmanship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.680
uh authentic craftsmanship. So so authentic craft&nbsp;
on level one. So goes the pyramid gets harder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:51.280
harder if climb the pyramid level one uh doodle&nbsp;
uh level zero doo level one's catch level two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.120
uh level three uh level four is a question uh&nbsp;
the craft. So basically I can take that idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.080
everything and make it like a 3D game. or make&nbsp;
it like a 3D model you know uh for example the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.480
freedom bird I can take it out and make it a&nbsp;
freedom bird in the world give some meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.280
you know make it like a product or something like&nbsp;
that that's what level four is authenticationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.400
and you got um sovereign car like sovereign&nbsp;
means like the soul or the biome it fits into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:22.160
the ecosystem like has a theme ecosystem so&nbsp;
sovereign like sovereignty it belongs there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.720
it's not an ar it's bas basically it's based on&nbsp;
the world like you know we humans live in earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:33.920
but it's like a roy is like in world is is weird&nbsp;
but you know if I'm a human in royald world um if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:39.520
a human royal is normal because there's the story&nbsp;
align with everything so this has the sovereign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:45.760
with sovereignty and that's what makes it um the&nbsp;
heart and the soul philosophy the soul the soul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:54.080
heart obi heart or soul this is one two zero one&nbsp;
two three four five for five and five is mentor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.920
six is mentor so mentor can teach anyone can teach&nbsp;
everyone about sovereignty uh about your origin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:05.840
my BF history, my BF history, um like who I&nbsp;
am, how how I treat people. And then you got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:16.960
um symbolic activist uh uh symbolic activist. It's&nbsp;
like activist symbolic um like oh so basically

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:24.720
so basically level one 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 level&nbsp;
seven is a sovereign like sovereign states. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.960
b that biome. part of that t that makes you buy&nbsp;
a part where you live it's sovereign that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:34.000
art that belongs there that's a culture that's the&nbsp;
meaning of symbols and then you got the sovereign&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.480
symbolic activist you got the um basically level&nbsp;
eight is symbolic it means something you know you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:45.440
know symbolic uh it's universal uh it belongs&nbsp;
to everyone anyone can notify it it's symbolic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.640
um but it's symbolic can activate I'm trying to&nbsp;
uh create new knowledge of art and culture I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.640 --> 00:15:00.400
trying to create new symbols uh like that me&nbsp;
origin my own business and thing and symbolic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.120
um sovereign activist like the sovereignty of&nbsp;
it is it so basically again this is part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.320
the writer framework it's called basically the&nbsp;
right framework um really about this you got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.880
sovereign activist like being sovereign&nbsp;
to yourself who you are basically for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.280
um uh see all this clothes I'm wearing it's all&nbsp;
boring it doesn't mean anything to it's just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.840
plain there's no innovation uh my personas it&nbsp;
doesn't maintain it doesn't mean anything it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.040
just like charity close it doesn't mean anything.&nbsp;
So this is just um your framework uh which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.760
also part of writing. This is like your creative&nbsp;
writing framework. It's like a uh how you uh um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:40.640
try to inci um and incidi language model uh which&nbsp;
is like um the the framework behind the writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:45.200
uh but it's like for drawing uh mainly for&nbsp;
drawing this just part one for you but your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:51.600
goal is to have this um pyramid uh uh universal&nbsp;
to the ordinary product so we can have authentic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.800
clothes authentic garments authentic wear you know&nbsp;
uh for it so it can use to draw it's called drawic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.960
uh because anyone that draws is called the&nbsp;
Anyone that draws is a drawer. Anyone that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.760
writes is a writer. But what makes make them&nbsp;
a writer? A writer is a drawer. Basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:11.440
you cannot I'm saying that it's part of writing&nbsp;
because you cannot draw without writing for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.800
because you know you have to plan your writing&nbsp;
because you plan you still write on paper and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.200
this. So basically the drawing framework is like&nbsp;
literally drawing and writing. So this is part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.640
the writing part called framework or the artist&nbsp;
framework. Um the goal is to have this universal.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:32.560
Uh so this is like uh the the thing I'm creating&nbsp;
for the uh authentic uh conscious mitigation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.680
conscious integration mitigation like you know uh&nbsp;
being sovereign being part of a community being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:43.200
part of something uh authentic arts that last&nbsp;
and last and last things that mean something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:50.160
symbolic things uh that mean something uh uh&nbsp;
basically um basically I'm going to try video&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:56.480
on the draws from it but this one I'm saying&nbsp;
to you it's it's authentic it's it's you soul&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.000
Uh I use a lot for a lot of uh writing to do it.&nbsp;
Um because I'm a writer too and a drawer. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
care what I draw or the picture. It's just uh&nbsp;
beautiful um to me. Uh but you know the goal here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:19.680
is to show um this just like someone looking up&nbsp;
in the sky like a robot. But that's me. Uh yep. Uh

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.560
uh it's about uh sovereignty. It's like uh&nbsp;
who you are. But this is basically um one more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.240
thing Nambdi to tell them to tell your people. So&nbsp;
basically since this is this is hella complicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:36.000
uh but this is basically you see this one here&nbsp;
or this art here uh anyone in OB anyone working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.880
with your framework must understand uh this is&nbsp;
basically this this is uh level zero automatically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:47.920
it's just a doodle why why is a doodle it can't&nbsp;
be uh it can't be a sketch it can't be a sketch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.160
uh because it doesn't mean so the metric how you&nbsp;
mark this so because freedom bird the flying birds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.040
with a wing uh the wing is looking up uh tries to&nbsp;
look up right right you know it's flying above is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.080
basically it's like a looking up at a bird and&nbsp;
has wings. Uh this is basically saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:07.440
do it's a dudo. Yes. Why? Because everything's at&nbsp;
level zero. If you if you think you're level two,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.440
uh you know, basically this is not expression&nbsp;
on my soul. It's it's a freedom. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.840
I see a freedom. But the freedom word freedom&nbsp;
doesn't mean anything if I don't have the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:24.080
um other one the art like the like the meaning&nbsp;
like the like the what I call the um po one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.200
Basically, if I have a poem with this as well.&nbsp;
So, this this bird freedom bird has a poem. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.560
I can make a poem right now. Like the bird was&nbsp;
free. It flew over. It never understood anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.400
but freedom and freedom was his name. Uh that poem&nbsp;
alone just gives you like uh the freedom bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.920
you know, but that people will not know it's a&nbsp;
freedom bird. So, basically your goal is to um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.640
take uh let me try to write the phone properly. Uh&nbsp;
let me just stop this video. Basically your goal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:59.520
is to So guys, anyone working with my framework&nbsp;
um level 0 to uh nine uh the freedom free free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:24.320
was the bird free uh wishes wishes uh wishes&nbsp;
which uh free will the bird flock flocking Three

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:37.440
block

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.600
guys to make a poem right now to see how this&nbsp;
works. So basically guys, I'm making a poem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.200
right now. So I want you guys to bear with me.&nbsp;
So basically go to Freedom Bird everything. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.720
this is called the Freedom Bird. um uh emotion uh&nbsp;
basically this is something called emotion pivots&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:58.960
and crisis. So emotion um emotion means like uh a&nbsp;
motive um uh you know basically the emotion crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.720
for is like um it's like um if you go to my medium&nbsp;
post I'm going to try to use it but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.720
uh let me try to find it actually guys um so&nbsp;
basically I I'm just using my explicit I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:17.760
trying to kind of find it like um here oh no you&nbsp;
know it's like a so basically this should be like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:32.160
um you know it's like you know locked somewhere&nbsp;
It should be locked in now. Uh so basically

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:38.320
so basically this is my uh medium. Uh I'm looking&nbsp;
for something called um uh crisis uh purpose and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:43.520
emotion. I should be here in my uh repository.&nbsp;
I didn't plan this is like the other ones. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:52.720
other one uh crisis um uh so basically oh it's&nbsp;
called Z regrets. Uh so yes this is zest regret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.320
please look at this but this is what the the&nbsp;
thing is. So you got like the BFR pattern,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.200
the P one uh the private key here. See this&nbsp;
private key? That's the B pattern. The P one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:09.680
the public key and the avatar uh the basically you&nbsp;
got the uh uh P the public key and art protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.080
But this is like um a pattern because you know the&nbsp;
B pattern is like B of butterfields the private&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.760
key you got the P which is art protocol and the&nbsp;
fracture but you don't want to about this. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.680
is where the art really is you know and then you&nbsp;
can use it for something else if it works in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:28.400
real world um which is how it is. So basically&nbsp;
see Z regrets um before you go um this is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.440
like uh the crisis um see this one. So basically&nbsp;
I'm trying to create one for the um show don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:40.640
tell. So this is a poem uh poem is like um a poem&nbsp;
a pro is not a poem because I'm saying to you I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.800
can be poetic but a pros is like me saying to&nbsp;
someone else I can sing to someone else. This a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:51.520
pros. So basically I can say sing about Juliet&nbsp;
my wish for Juliet but if it's about Juliet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:58.800
um where you know even one sent one word of Juliet&nbsp;
Romeo and Juliet you will learn my lover that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.800
pros because it's not it's not a poem because&nbsp;
you're not singing about yourself. You can say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.440
I'm falling in love with a beautiful woman but you&nbsp;
cannot say Juliet or like um her name because that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.160
says she's an example. Uh I love her but you can&nbsp;
say I love women but you don't understand why you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:19.200
love women. So the difference between a poem and&nbsp;
a pros first of all is because the poem is only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:24.960
you you you me myself and I. You speak about your&nbsp;
feelings who you are but pro you speak about your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.440
love your interest what you do um that's your bas&nbsp;
like a show don't tell. So basically show don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.680
tell you show the audience this like part of the&nbsp;
motion. So basically character crisis relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:43.360
uh internal conflict stakes uh in certain&nbsp;
incidents settings and um setting. So basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:48.480
this is just a uh this is this model is a crisis&nbsp;
pivots. Um basically this is crisis that happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:54.560
in a story for example uh why is there a freedom&nbsp;
bird? Why is why does a bird fly? What's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:01.200
crisis? Why is it free flock [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] free? Why does&nbsp;
want to be part of a flock? You know what what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.520
the significance of having a freedom bird? That's&nbsp;
the crisis. But you know it's based on trilogy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:10.880
So the model of this is like um really um uh&nbsp;
like you know you got like a forest but a forest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:18.720
alternative is like uh creative um formally.&nbsp;
So alliteration uh uh fact uh alliteration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:33.920
uh uh alliteration uh facts and figures uh uh&nbsp;
onia wait uh uh questions uh a motive language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:40.000
uh basically this one's like um long simile and&nbsp;
met of and rule of threads you know this like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.800
um for like non creative writing like formal&nbsp;
writing use to um write to uh formal bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:51.440
uh but is like a for techniques the techniques cuz&nbsp;
they're not using the same specification but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.760
know it's for creative writing so this what I'm&nbsp;
doing for my uh English basically this right is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.320
why it's part of right so good cuz you know let&nbsp;
me explain now so you got the crisis uh crisis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:06.480
is like um character your character is the heart&nbsp;
of a story reader must care about them uh at root&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.400
of them but never fear them so basically the goal&nbsp;
is this is like you continue so you for everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:19.040
you create the freedom bird you create uh you&nbsp;
must care for them focus on each character depth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.400
uh the quirks and motivation uh for example my&nbsp;
freedom bird who is my freedom bird uh basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.520
the character must be like um itself you know like&nbsp;
I fly I can't say basically instead of me saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.120
um um so this how you use the framework&nbsp;
properly so basically I got to do properly so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:42.720
I am I am free I am free flock so there's a bird&nbsp;
speaking and that's a po one I am free of flock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:54.080
I'm free of the flock. Free. I am free of&nbsp;
the flock. You know, free bird, freedom bird

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.440
in my kingdom. In my king

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:09.760
with my

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.360
shoulder.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:22.960
Okay. Basically with my wisdom&nbsp;
with my wisdom I I build

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:28.880
I am my own kingdom.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.520
Basically the kingdom is like the birds fly&nbsp;
around. Basically it flies itself. It's free.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.600
It's it's it own you know that's example I'm&nbsp;
giving you guys. So it's a freedom bird. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.800
calling it a freedom bird. But the idea of this&nbsp;
is for you to understand this framework. Um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:49.280
this is like the writing here. I am free um um&nbsp;
uh basically if you try to put this narrative&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.120
chip in here. So basically you just try to do it&nbsp;
now. Oh my battery my battery is going to die. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:04.720
battery going to die. Sorry guys. This scares&nbsp;
me man. It it just pumps my heart up like so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.480
basically I'm trying to do this now. Uh it's&nbsp;
about you using what you know about what you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.960
see observing the world and making I am free&nbsp;
of the flock with my wisdom like the wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:25.520
being dumb. Uh dumb means like kingdom I am my own&nbsp;
kingdom you know. Uh and then let me just give you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.480
I'm not going to do the whole thing. Of course&nbsp;
I'm not going to do the whole thing. Be long.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.120
Uh then that's just the character and it gives&nbsp;
everything has there and then other one that's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:41.040
motion that's the motion basically the motion is&nbsp;
like driven so basically um what's the motive of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.440
the character why are they free what do they want&nbsp;
it's like problem statement um explanation what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.880
do they want um so basically the obstacle they&nbsp;
must overcome is basically based on the you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:57.280
like the the the beginning middle and end trilogy&nbsp;
uh is based on something called the the the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.320
Basically in all cultures guys there's something&nbsp;
called um in all stories in all stories like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.080
there's something called narrative like&nbsp;
narative I've got a hero hero journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:15.040
or the heroin's journey um but the heroine's&nbsp;
journey is like um the same thing so this just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.440
the same thing beginning and there's a happy&nbsp;
ending and we got like movies about them you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.520
know that's what the media come from you know&nbsp;
they tell the story in pictures you know moving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:32.800
pictures which are movies uh or animation&nbsp;
Uh so you got motivation obstacle theme.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.520
So this like uh basically the&nbsp;
motivation one one my purpose is uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:49.440
uh free to act free to judge me not judge me&nbsp;
not uh uh so what's my question to free cuz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:57.520
you know it feels limited it feels&nbsp;
confined by the flock free to act

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.360
free to act to be free to act Uh

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:14.800
uh basically you also define so it obscures like&nbsp;
um the um free to act uh free from judgment I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:28.960
come to um curiosity is my wisdom basically it's&nbsp;
curious and that's supposed to be free uh I build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.640
Uh basically the wisdom, the kingdom. Uh I am the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.680
um basically um I build I am I build my&nbsp;
own kingdom. Oh basically I build my own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:44.480
kingdom. I build one second. One second.&nbsp;
Let me try. Okay. I'm trying to make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:56.400
better. Uh city is my wisdom. I build&nbsp;
my own kingdom. I am my own kingdom. I

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:15.440
I met uh quick my uh wisdom. Met&nbsp;
metamorphosize meta move um move to wisdom.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:23.040
So basically I'm I am free uh of the flock.&nbsp;
With my wisdom, I build my own kingdom. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:37.920
free to act. Free from judgment. Curiosity is my&nbsp;
wisdom. I move. I I move. I transform. Uh, I move.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.720
I move. Uh, I move. Um, I move.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:52.720
Sovereign sovereign sovereignty I

00:29:52.720 --> 00:30:00.160
declare my sovereignty basically I I declare&nbsp;
uh my sovereignty like you know my freedom I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:11.920
declare my freedom uh I declare my sovereignty&nbsp;
I am free basically that's basically see this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.880
one is beginning, middle and end. So,&nbsp;
I'm teaching you how to guys how to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.640
um arting thing. Uh this like um the and how&nbsp;
to add rhythm. So, basically this is just the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:26.000
this like the mind map for Z regress. Uh you&nbsp;
can check that out. But you know Z1 was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.920
um uh animation. Uh then we got um uh so that's&nbsp;
crisis. The last one this like one I did for SIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:42.480
the stanza but that's in haiku. Uh so basically&nbsp;
uh pivots emotion crisis uh piv basically the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:49.120
this is like um uh crisis the crisis that happens&nbsp;
the pivots the change and then uh the motion is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:57.440
like the resolution. Um so basically the mission&nbsp;
I am the I am the I am okay free okay basically I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:07.120
have to say something I am free of the flock uh uh&nbsp;
with my wisdom I build my kingdom free to act free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:19.360
uh judge uh free of judgment free of judgment&nbsp;
curiosity is my wisdom I declare my sovereignty

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:27.520
free a free and the free uh free is the flock.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:35.840
Uh as free as freedom

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:45.680
can be I am the freedom bird.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:52.240
I am I am the freedom. So this like um the poem&nbsp;
now you see this crisis uh pivot emotion I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.920
to talk about something else um but the writer's&nbsp;
framework I'll come to the other one this just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.920 --> 00:32:01.760
the let me quot so this one here I'm going to&nbsp;
try to read out to you uh uh live not life so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:09.280
this one here so I am it's like the about the bird&nbsp;
kind of thing so basically you see here so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.720
see so this like the art I drew and there's a&nbsp;
reason why I drew it is like because of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:19.280
uh so basically you can look at this first uh&nbsp;
here I can't really show you. This is some paper,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.520
but it's like weird and it's like dirty.&nbsp;
Uh, but you know, that's what I'm think. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:28.880
you got to remember, uh, this a doodle.&nbsp;
This a doodle. Uh, but the doodle is like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.880
uh, the last one, but this everyone's basically&nbsp;
everyone's at level zero. Unless they,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.280
uh, if you think you're level, if you try&nbsp;
to draw level three, uh, level one, two, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.520
you're zero because if it's just peer review, your&nbsp;
work, anything, you doing business with anyone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.920
uh, but you're level zero automatically because&nbsp;
you don't have like, um, a thing expression. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.240
your expression. Uh but it's a doodle. Um it's&nbsp;
still a doodle and a sketch. So you are either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.600
um doodling or or sketching. But you don't this&nbsp;
my expression. I think I'm a level two. Uh but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.280
there's other reasons to suggest I'm not level.&nbsp;
You have to think of other reasons basically. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.720
basically this freedom bird is level zero. Let me&nbsp;
think. It could be level zero because he's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:13.520
outline. There's no actual um sketching uh not&nbsp;
sure form. But I can argue there's more form than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.440
in doodle because doodle is just boring stuff.&nbsp;
Gives no form. It's more abstract. So this I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:22.960
say this a level one but is it authentic? Oh yeah&nbsp;
it's like me. I am free. Um so I would say I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.240
level two. Yes. Level two. So this level two piece&nbsp;
of uh uh this level of freedom bird. So it does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.200
match level two. Uh level one uh level zero level&nbsp;
one. Level two uh of the authentic expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.720
This my authentic expression. Now the po one&nbsp;
here is other one. So this is the freedom bird.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:46.800
I am free of the flock. Um I'm free of the flock.&nbsp;
With my wisdom I build my own kingdom. Free are to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:55.520
act. Free from judgment. Curiosity is my wisdom.&nbsp;
I declare my sovereignty. Is that what it is? Free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:04.560
is the flock. As free as freedom can be. I am the&nbsp;
freedom bird. You get it? Freedom bird. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.760
one thing. So this thing is this level three. But&nbsp;
now this like a public key to my artwork example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.960
So if you go up to the top uh so basically there's&nbsp;
copy infringement everything. So this is a private&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.520
key here. This will be the freedom birth here.&nbsp;
Uh the private key is the freedom birth. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.240
the public key I can give everyone the pool one&nbsp;
is a public key and that's the R protocol. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:31.200
it's sample proof 2.5 percentile 0%. If I see&nbsp;
infringement on this work I can sue anyone. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.320
but you know that's our protocol. The public key&nbsp;
it shows to everyone. It's free to see. But the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.920
poem I can give to anyone but that's interpreted&nbsp;
because they cannot interpret something that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.400
very abstract like that. So if I give someone&nbsp;
this poem, they see it as an art protocol. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.240
don't understand and then they try to decipher&nbsp;
it and they say, "Oh, what did you draw?" But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.520
if I give someone a poem and show them the art um&nbsp;
I can basically I can clear two poems. I can give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.800
what this freedom bird means to me. And they say,&nbsp;
"Why did you create it? I created a freedom bird&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.600
uh because um because I created a freedom bird&nbsp;
because I want to express myself." Yes. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:09.600
know the poem here uh two I can give them one poem&nbsp;
uh everyone to see. I can give them a little poem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.000
uh keep one poem. So if there's any copyright&nbsp;
infringement, they see the freedom bird and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.560
and I say um if you go to court, it's going to be&nbsp;
a dispute. Uh so it's going to be a problem. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.280
the the the the thing about this freedom bird is&nbsp;
that um the private it's a private key. It's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:29.040
it has to be. It has to be separate. Uh it's going&nbsp;
to be two to one. It's like owner oral skill. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.920
the avatar is a basically uh if there's an avatar&nbsp;
basically this my avatar. I'm the avatar. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:40.640
the freedom. I'm the freedom. you know uh because&nbsp;
triggers like the trigger uh is like um I trigger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:45.920
something like you know the trigger is like me uh&nbsp;
if I'm angry I'm the avatar basically this is my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:51.440
alternate expression this is my persona this is my&nbsp;
trademark work uh and then legal automation uh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:55.920
basically the computer can check this a computer&nbsp;
can check this uh basically goes to franchise&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:02.560
nodes uh computing publishing and art uh computing&nbsp;
open computing open publishing uh book arts like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.480
it goes to write industry it goes to do the goes&nbsp;
to solve the problem. It's going to basically it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.600
going to be authentic for that scenario for that&nbsp;
biome for where you are. Uh which I'm saying to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:18.240
you uh this one zero is regret this like Z one&nbsp;
uh color palette Japanese ornament. But this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.080
like she meets basically she has the devil in her&nbsp;
room. She's cursing the devil overnight praying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:27.840
overnight. Uh you can look at this read it out&nbsp;
this article and this like the thing uh I did this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:34.400
a stanza. Um so that's the freedom bird for you.&nbsp;
It's better because it's more authentic. Uh uh but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.200
you know that's going to be copyright everything&nbsp;
if you want to see it. Uh it's level two. I'm glad&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.200
I achieved it cuz it's like uh there's a it's not&nbsp;
like I stop I didn't stop it. I just did it well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:52.080
enough to my ability and I and I'm happy with that&nbsp;
specificity um with that art uh protocol. Uh so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.920
am I done with this video? Yes. So uh so basically&nbsp;
what you guys do is create something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:08.640
um basically built in infrastructure as a service.&nbsp;
So as um architecture as infrastructure a a

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:12.720
you know that's architecture as infrastructure&nbsp;
because the architecture is built into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:17.200
design basically if I want to design this&nbsp;
for use anything you can design like a light&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.000
uh like a a light lamp that floats in like like&nbsp;
a light bulb like it does this that look like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.560
this um and build it because basically my&nbsp;
company is designed to clean company um but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:33.120
that's idea you sovereignty you have the soul&nbsp;
in it you have what you want in it. Um uh yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.480
it's like uh it is like that. So your goal is to&nbsp;
have the sovereign. Uh anything I forgotten? No.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.040
Okay, I'll go back to Thank you for watching this&nbsp;
video. Uh like, share, and subscribe if you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:50.080
but this is just me reflecting on my work. Um&nbsp;
uh uh Dr. Sovereign uh and have a look. Take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:56.640
care. Here we go. So YouTube just actually&nbsp;
just caps this and put this properly. Um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.480
this is like a like a thumbnail or something. So&nbsp;
it's going to be look like this skele. But guys,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:10.160
I should not lose this. So uh again NDI uh&nbsp;
uh level zero is a doodle. Uh level one is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:16.400
catch. Uh level two is external expression.&nbsp;
Uh which is this. Level three is symbolic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.680
