OK, this is the should we looking right in right now? Is it writing the stuff? No. Yes, it is. Is it right? It is not Umm. No, OK, let me just go to other AI because I don't trust. The system and then we should perform. This should be fine. Record done. So let me tell this, probably the title of this is a filter flash interpretation. For sports growth. For tomography. With the tomographic. Tomograph oK, so basically what am I doing here? I have to just search. Try to Jordan, keep quiet. Jordan, Jordan, stop. What am I doing now? And I'm D? What am i doing now as i don't care about dude fully men should be why I started the video on. All pictures desktop are. 14 point something kudiyaathu aamaa. OK, I'll learn straight. Basically this image under this one's Uchinamdi. So it's like a table, one girl of Kitchenami. It's like a my avatar, but it's like not being cutting from. It's not a puppet and it's like cartoon memory, dark skin, glasses. What kind of my art or avatar this was called? My heart logo, my circle up image on medium silver collapse manifesto by Namdi Merkabah on behalf of anyone in person living under serious cover up. So I'm not in the house and stuff. August in 2005 and it's like watercolor this or a show. So basically a problem. You know, it's never like a it's a birth certificate. For change, but I'm gonna make the change but it's like a it's a cleaner unless you feel my channel, I really won't care if you follow or not. But this is my biggest update but it's also risk test upgrade update. So I'm trying to make it 30 minutes or less. Let me go see. So you got this. You got rift Rift, which is a rift is a flag with translator. But you got a roof test. A roof test. Roof test. So go to a Rift test, which is the testing library for Rift. But you see, it's about Rift test really. But why is rooftop powerful? Just like there's nothing here for now, but I'll show you why the Rifters test library. So this is the roof test, but it seems like you don't understand what this is. But you know, I'll, I'll come back to that later. Is this what it's about? Secure Rift uh, which can do a lot of things uh, based on install scoring. Basically, this is the model, uh, consciousness, uh, doing software energy, but you know, you go with the testing of the loved ones. So basically it's very important to do it properly. So, but I want to show you the repository I'm working on. So you got the R capital R under score open. Which is the the rift open Basically it's a program like a run to open any artifacts on windows. You guys kind of this we get political, but it's like the license you get to run with. I get the conjugate model. Yeah, you get told it's about this testing. So basically I'm gonna show you this via the Rift test library. So are open is the library you can go to see our open. We can download this here do this one. So what's the video important? Why is it really important? Shut up with your job. Sorry, Azar. No, keep quiet. You don't do your job. Yes, it's my turn. You're not doing nothing as a you know you're not doing nothing. No, don't start. You don't start basically I don't sorry. I was seeing don't want him there as I don't watch my video. You know my friend as a sorry. So basically with this is. So roof test is like the testing library for roof, but it's like a. If there's also. This thing, what's this thing which is a library, but it was something called filter flash from top. So when you filter something you're sorting out, you're organizing it, you're, you're trying to process it because you're doing some kind of competition on it, which is like a start scoring. I don't have training 11. Graph filtering is an interpretation of a system state openness division. So when you finish something, you're interpreted, but you're running some kind of function. Can be logged in, can be logged in over login space-time. It can be 01 doesn't really want to fluttering. It's like, you know, the default for like a a filtering, sorting out. So searching stuff on searching algorithms, sorting algorithms, emerging algorithms, Mercedes, anything that I'm put up, it's not a flash. If there's any, any PO filter can be snow flush because if you don't, it's only for processing. If it's in process is stored, has the flash to get the future flash quality. But you know, the rift test is basically when you get vertical flash, we get a flash. You can start with the corner piece of a puzzle. I'm already flushed this started, so this person input a seat like it doesn't matter what's not in the puzzle, but I couldn't find the first kind of this I like it, I like it. I have to place it separate from robots to make the full image. What is like a Starship doesn't matter or the bottom of the ocean or this images here the filter flash functions are are are. Bioterrorism of the Birmingham but you know you can when you flash something you store it, but you know it's dryadadic because it's a it works in a function, so you can flash anything flash can be into a fixture, anything can be a flash via tryactic sparse modeling, but with that works on tomographic. So what are you about that? So basically. Imagine I want to hack something, but I don't know the state of that system. It's a like a but I can't guess this thing. I can guess the state of that system and no matter what to buy an IP address by good IP address. Really it's a static app, just you know, but I have the website or URL. You know. Dynamic, so it routes me to some kind of. A stick, but then it went to like a a let me say like a hack me hack me hack hack the box a dog or hack me, hack me hack me. But now you know hack me the last IP address 198126. 0.1. UK, you know UK unions but some kind of region and UK based on some kind of state I was in. Oh, but you know this is still hackable because it doesn't matter where I am in the UK. How can be done now as a doesn't last. So if I know this, my state and how the geomorphic system set up, I can still break the lattice. Basically doesn't have to change the alignment, I can polarize my picking a lock. You know, basically I'm seeing select systems, outrageous rules, but you know, I can still break a dynamic system 'cause they are it's like picking a lot of them lock my the lock might change the pin, changing the pin. So after pick a location to to authenticate some kind of services. I can break the IP again and you get the least one stack IPO in that timing framework. It doesn't really matter why it's not fully sports if it's not spouse, but it's just dynamic. It just does rerouting which I'm going for. So you get 198 and 128. So basically just like AIP 3-4 address if I type. I have a beautiful address. I should be able to get those set in the old way, but you know, the the site is just putting this average is a pointer system just IP address, which I'm saying tickets. So the idea of this with that is just to show this kind of experience of your consensus modeling, which I could try direct. Yes, yes, yes. Are you allowed permission? Yes, yes, yes. Consent and you said you allowed consensus to do some of your dynamic tomographic, but you know, I'm trying to make sure it's good. So how does work in practice so you can have a relay attack? No, what is a relay attack? What is a relay attack? A relay attack is like you know, you know a system state, you know some kind of. Of offices, you know, you see, you have noise, you have it there noise, but then it's equal some signal or your signal. So this is your signal. So you know, you know, some states they, they, they that's you know that no one knows, you know. So example basically it's like a say, I can observe something. I can measure it 100%, but I can put it back no matter. No matter what the attackers are relayed. For example, I send the same signal back to the system, but system has to process it. You normally have a backlog. You you, you receive the bike lock, you pick the lock configuration. You know, Insight will also have a door lock. This is one of the master lock. You know, 'cause you put your your king or your screwdriver, you didn't push it right. Go to some combination left, right and you know the lock. You start to get more information. You know, 'cause you know the lock allows you to. Mechanically twisted, it just allows to be broken. Same. So realize that it's like same thing here because it allows you to see what you're doing without by knowing the state of the system. You know, get more information. But basically if you know half information, if you know 1/4 of you know half already because there's some kind of chemical standards university to all that kind of luck. What is your master? Look here, there's no master. Look at that system. It's perfect 'cause you have the different key in the system. But if it's a master key, it's a master lock. It's a, it's a problem there. So the idea here is like, can't you get observed? Say example like you know, if I'm so basically if I have, if I have to, if I get a signal. There are noise, I can sever the signal bit by bit without consensus, but basically the idea here is to have gossip and scale the observer consumer model for sparse interpretation and which is the filter flash functor mapping so you get the functor 2 to one. Two data or functions to 1 output and that one output has two other one or two other functions. So you get 21 and impossibility if you have a 2 biting you have a space if you have a space-time function. It's not 622 outputs, the space is some storage of 50 because in time is like half the time 25 meters. You get 5050 megabytes per per per per half time 25 seconds. Was it this time 50 is a login basically I've given basically you get 155050 megawatts. How much is 50 megabytes? 111 bytes it with. At the one MB. Is a one 1001 megabytes, one KB and 2:00 and 1:00. 1000 kilobytes obviously you get, let's say you get 50 kilobytes, that's like 5-5 KB. You know, so get 50 kilobytes or megabytes and that's one five we get over the time, so 5 seconds and this is 1/2 time. But you know, just like not even good enough, OK, basically a kilo is 1000, so it's 1000, so you get 5000 kilobytes. Let's see 5500 thousand 5000 kilobytes, OK, you get one MB 1K500 KB over the time of 25 seconds of half, 60 seconds, 30 seconds. That would be 5 by three 1.3 occurring. But another idea, Deja Zhu. Uh-huh. Uh, get some kind of function? Was the bunker villa because tomography is the key. Tomography is the key. The idea you look in the inside, for example, you have some kind of a volume. Basically you are trying to see you have like a cube. Like a sphere you have the, a sphere you have the area, you have the surface area. We try to figure out the volume density, so it is like. So. So for example, what that means is like this, you get the service area. What do I mean? So what that means? You get the service area. That means you get 2π two Pi 2π R is a surface of the wages IS100100. 1100 meters miles Meters. 100 feet. 1000 feet. Out of it and then the readers is A50. Uh, centimeters. A50 which is 150 a hundred feet and then you get the pie 3.14. The two Pi 2 * π R unless it's like a 3.14. So you get a 100, a 100,000. 100 a 100,000 centimeters. But you know you don't know this, you know the area which is just this component which you have to pick the lock to try to get the components there. This is confusing me so this comes down. You get some kind of a conclusion, for example. Let me book a book at all. Basically this is your usual 100,000. 100 or 1000 feet to 100. So get the calculator, it's a good online calculator here. 100 and radius, let's say 100 centimeters, 100 centimeters, 100 centimeters times a π * π. Oh π is what's times 2.4. That's 340. About 2040 centimeters is not a squared 'cause it's not a volume. So that's the parameter. So you, you know, you get the three items too, so you get them too. I'll have to get what is 262628318. Or 61854 you know, you know 6361 bits like I send emails Q ^2 perimeter. It's like a service area. It's like you know how much you go on the perimeter, but you have to have some kind of function. That's a pretty simple aerobic thing for one unit, for one go of the radius you get. The unimodal Aza, Sorry, sorry, sorry Sir. So for when you go to 1 unit, you go to units the way you select. Take a look, someone slipped him out, you know, some dynamically without telling them to lock them out. Basically that's the idea. It's not meant to meet this one, it's meant to make it a universal bound, so that I did a demography you used to test it no matter the airship to you. For example the. Are open expense bound by tomography, which is the observing, Specially if I send a signal, a chemical signal, Yeah, chemical signal. I observe that state, but you know, it doesn't mean that I give them no noise, no noise or no signal. It's like a, but I use this propagation of the states, the equilibrium of the state, because then they, they can't measure this. This is just, there's just noise to them. There's nothing here you can see this, there's no, there's nothing you can detect in this room. So this is just like me trying to go in with the relay and I just have some kind of thing that they take a medium. You should meet them to them, there's nothing here. So when I get a signal, their signal, I can replay it backwards in the way. Obviously I can replay this thing so the media, no noise, no signal. It's like an insecure channel because I'm really. This channel myself and signals through a window, but you know the signals are digital so 01010201 for some time and then one up and then one down. You know it's basically digital noise but that's going to show more byte 101 but you know this has been reverse you know. Muscles is like a tomography bound to how I measure how I polarize the thing so I can get my medium better or I can start interpretation information in what time and what I look like. Sorry, sorry. So Cortana what's about 10%, it's just like how it works. So it's going to be like a so it's going to relay system. So this is relay system works for chicken the again holding it for. So you get some coding, let me just send you all the information to the job, to swimming. Cool, a configuration that is fast to unlock the system. But for me, 'cause you know, you only know the model, so you don't. Do you know how to cook? Confirmation, uh, in which time. So that's like it. It doesn't uh, allow fragmentation because the system already. It's like a so how this work in practice? In practice you work by you defining what I call a sparse filter function to office. So you get the Buckner form. So it's all programs you get the Buckner form. Buckner which is the Hamiltonian inerring edge Brown, Hamiltonian node Brown like data node and edge Brown encoding node. The structure how basically and you get the investor group so basically if the streamer bite is positive you. You have, you're measuring the negative, basically, you're basically because it's not safe for you because you know you're observing it. So basically if it's positive, you are observing negative. So, but you know it's positive because you know someone says secure, you know you know. Using reverse loss psychology here. So if you get like a a a module 1, you are this means a 101 you are reversing this so you are you can 00120 on the last time you want to get A10 means 10. So this kind of thing is what you need. Not sure we can get you for SO the Buckner form is the standard. A Polish notation for passing your breakfast search or or the first thing so that we have like a modulation. 101101123456788 But you know this can be two ways. This can be a duplex 3 you never know so it's gonna receive it and respond. Or this can be A1 stream like a one with a standard stream. To you just send one, send one, send them, but we don't know, we don't get. So you have to work with. So how do you look like if I receive a zero and I know it's 00101, I have to ensure this is either encoding some kind of information. This actually some data I did some data or some or some transformation that can download it or some kind of blog over some IP. I don't know what it is you know, but I have to start to put two and two together. Uh, so this can be 12345678. So what I know this number is just a arbitrary thing. I don't really know what it is, but I know it's some data so I can start collecting information and stop piercing it together. So in this room it gives me mean nothing. But so how do I do some breakfast? Search breakfast. So this would be basically 01 would be 00 left foot or one right foot zero left foot one right nude with 0. Left foot, zero. Right snooze, one left foot. Left router I didn't go up 1 chain. Left router 0 on the right one you should stand at 3, so 0. 001 for background, but it's like a left root right that's you go. You put on the left nose or do it now you go left one and you go right go you go right. This is Buckner and go to right route left. So that's the number. So this was 0 right to be 10. Alright, so this will be 0 it will be 1 zero and this will be 10. So basically get the opposite here in the this is block now or three. So these three are the same the one just opposite. So this is. The reputation of the computer program view some kind of health coding. So this would mean here that you know left nude. So if I use a breakfast search algorithm, I start with the bottom. So this will be 01/01. Umm, no. This can mean this can either mean UH-010. 'Cause that's the oh, that's weekly, the breakfast, the bottom note 01. Like a set of information, 01/01. Just as interested, for Buckner type 1, can we either 01/01 some information there and they will go some 10 the next step and get 00 and get 3 settings the same thing you get another one get 0110 and you get 01 and you get 0 basically. Same thing but so if I get A10 this will be one to four six. So once you I get that number 4566601. 6/1. I thought this was he gets #7 here, but he's 72 so you get. So basically this can mean 7 in binary. How do you get some the top one? 'Cause it's bottom up, you're meant to reach from the bottom, although you basically don't know if you 7 either way. So it's like if you get this will be 0123. 'Cause you know, one in the two place to the 2, two in the one place, one in the two place, and one in the three places to be. And this would be 131 and this before she can be either 7 or 4, you know. So I get 2 provision channel for possible this one, this including seven or four are in bark now for now bark now is done. So the other one is a. It's in the background for seven the in a in a in reverse Polish. What it's like a, a reverse Polish is like a a what's a a It's like a a reverse Polish is what? It's like a fork. So basically I'm going to show you my competition to show you I worked it up. Well, you know, don't have to see some kind of internal structure of the system. It doesn't matter what it is, it has to fix some kind of his own principles of protocol. So basically you are into 7 system, but you're not really trying to. You're trying to get as much information as possible before you actually do something. So basically it's the work. So I'm trying to maximize this now guys let me just maximize this. I don't want to put some time to make it full screen fit the screen. So it's like this. You see this here. Stop seeing personal client do nothing. So this is a security so that I get so the bump number is like the other one. He don't, he's an infix one if it's humorable artifacts, which is just a root left right now depending on the ending is of the system. Influence your business, you just like standard kind of good Jason, but don't trust that stuff because the computer has to store pause it. But you know, it's just there as an option if you don't want to try to use it. It's more human friendly for encryption, but you know there's no way to throw it away. So the ideas are some kind of a twin and resolve. For it's but how much universal scheme the how much is it is the the thing from the university Illinois State. So what that means the Hamiltonian state is the state means that the Hamilton state. They work, they do some job, they try to find the path, but you know, they have other different properties. So a node can have a density, but a density is not a weight. It's not a weight, which is what it has to be. The node can have a density. It can be like a 0.7 meaning. If you rank a node up 0.7. Of which because you know this as well as you depend on like a dependency kind of a system, a kind of acoustic. Example 85 is a standard. Damping factor. If a node has a damping factor of the effect, it's very important because otherwise has a 1 minus E5, which would be. 25225 so if you have two notes 1/2 to make sure the algorithm runs smoothly, but if the factor have equilibrium, the nodes have the notes the first traversal. 'Cause you know it's more important to do something than don't do it. And then what has weight. So basically the only difference is that the. Based on implementation requirements which can be chemicalized to for echo TB based principles first past summer preference. So the idea is you define some kind of function. Some kind of function? The master with a footer flash duality to show Hamiltonian and urinary region for synchronization. Because if you're Hamiltonian rotation it's Easter bar Easter scoring, you got the opposite one to deal with. So the edgebound 1 is different from the, so you have to prune a lot. So you don't want to prune anything. So the example if the Hamiltonian cycle is going clockwise or going clockwise, the unicycle's going until conquerors. So there's one going some of the basically you have to synchronize operation with some kind of blooming functional. That's how the relation works. Obviously if you're seeing, if you've seen a unarian system, you're processing it, but you can cut off because. You can use a different channel that the government because the image is assumed by some just to say that the system, you just have to absorb the stereo system if it's in area. But you know if you're Hamiltonian system, you have to model it. But if you if you if you diffuse from the data set. What do you think is chemical? And there were they they can detect YouTube so you are not fully invisible unless you know how to mirror the system perfectly and be the listening without being addicted. So it doesn't matter the IP address is spec or not, it just matters the the the queue if you use a queue and. That's kind of this kind of thing and it's like you have to queue to stack so you have to have to so you can start the queue or just rotate it. Obviously if I transfer if I have a queue of bytes seen bytes. Let me just tell them to see, uh, the seven bytes of date. Ah uh, what is your number? It's a function to annoy me as well. So this man is just in there. So #7 or 7 or 4 or 7 or 4 is a 01/6 7:00 so you get 6. 01/01 you get the number 6767, so that's seven or 6-7 or four. Now this one. Is the iconical 1. It's comfort, vision, all the same thing. It's not meant to present decisions to be full. If I say it's a little bit before and seven at, sometimes it's 4/7 or 7/4. Seven or four or this is kind of a number there like a misunderstood Africa get the one he's just too bad. Seriously, my other so 50% if I don't have any additional information. So if I see if I'm seeing it from the advanced cycle, I'm seeing this data set, this matrix. 7447 This means that I'm seeing information what it could be, but nobody just so it's binary, but you know if I can put the two together and in my own system I can frame it as a system. How to dismiss the if I'm using edgebound Eulerian graph, a functor EA function EE has?.ically. A some kind of Wick. My goal now is either ticket and leave, ticket and leave or or or or or seated. So this will be this if I transpose this matrix in function EI can get. 747-7410 times this I get. Entity metrics and what's the chemical state of it? So 7 * 4 * 4 * 7 seven over 4. That would be sometimes a full is 7 * 4, which we can do this way. We can do this way four times. 4 = 16 which is 1 node. We do 7 * 7 = 49. I'm gonna do it plus plus. Which I never get. 16 + 4949 plus. So first of all force themselves 4747. For some so oh so so this is 7 * 4 which is 28 not 49. And we get that 1616 plus this to be the bottom one, the bottom 1 plus. 16 + 7. 16 plus. 16 + 7. Times. 4 * 4 is 16. Oh it's 4 * 7 is what 49 is 2828 plus wasn't 4, it's 16. That would be 20 + 1620 + 16, which would be the kinda cool one. To be basically it's it's basically you get 28 + 16 which would be 8910111230. Florine Florine 34444 Now this is the matter for the four, for the bottom hole, for the 444. The characteristic of this is 44 and the IO2 matrix. But you know, I can keep listening. So if I keep, if I, if I relay this stage, basically if I really if I could play this to the system, it will know it's 7 * 7, but I can continue that because it works in a lattice operations, I can. I mean, I just took your system. So this is like a for the music you get for the four and the corners for the four and Y corners for the four, for the four row and for the four for the one column. This system can either mean either basically if I do the times, if I didn't send identity, I'm saying I send in #4 or something. But I can get some more information, a lesson. Reconnaissance view of the Duncan system and stop proving it the lock, obviously I did for the 4 / 4. I guess what, 1111? So it's only 11 or 44 / 7? Which are the four or seven? So basically it would still be basically 7 * 7 is 49 seven times 6 is 42. So it used to be for two remainder 2 for 2.2 dot. We should be some battery, of course, some kind of. It is positive. Usually it gives information because the matrix lattice quantum university is bound to the operations of the system. But you have to measure the currently no matter how the Hamiltonian. What is Hamiltonian is the system that's sending or receiving like uploading and downloading. You already intercepted it because if you're uploading you can use Hamiltonian. 1A relay because 11 a little bit late 'cause you really in a system just understands the state already 'cause you know it's just edgeball. But the Hamiltonian can be what's useful. From point of patients we have polarity. I think you guys watch it. I'm going out with Vitriana. You don't give a ****. I'm flying ****. I'm in a number. Let me go. Thank you guys for watching video. Try to implement. You can improve your own relations for digital. Yeah. I think you really broke a lot of the security. But you know, I underlined before anything I do. I'm just a teacher, guys. I don't really care what I teach. But I'm teaching you guys 'cause you know, you get clinical rules, so you can get some clinical operation that's kind of cool here, plus some coding that times divide. You get the kind of code invest, which is like divide times. But if you get divide times, you get the other one, which is one of our dividends, which is just the unit model. So if you have time to divide, you have time to stand divide. You are then have the wish like a,nd to 1000. Segment space, do you have the other one, one of the smallest units you can use to get some more fractional data from it from this video stream. Thank you guys for watching guys. I'm welcome. Oh OK, some good stomach. Well, it don't. I mean, I don't don't understand me. OK, I'm done with you. Goodnight. Don't stop me. Good man. No, I don't turn off the light for you. No, you don't start this nonsense. You know what you're doing here, I say. You're doing nothing here. I'll also mention that how relay what is a relay? What is a relay? By all the nexus 4th via CT. CT we have polarity modeling policy. Pause. Uh, little pause. Keep quiet as I are. Sorry. I mean said I don't give a **** man. I don't know Superman Azar, why you join your friend? You don't have to.
