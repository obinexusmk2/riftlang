So the mic is now transcribing, I'm now transcribing my voice to use auto AI, keep a backup of everything and then this very, very possibility. I've still started video. OK guys, the video hasn't started so it's not starting now. OK, so. Recording. Oh, it just started. So recording. 52 one thing oh oh oh they just create 2 active scenes so I can start the active scene recording of scene 2 so I don't have to switch to scene 2 which is new feature. Actually I I, I OK let me just try to record scene 2. At the same time. Oh, no, no. Oh, so there's two things recording now that's seen one and scene 2. OK, let me just go back to scene one. But scene 10 and scene 9, OK, I can hear my voice. It's hearing. Everything's going according to plan. So this is recording 2 scenes, 2 scenes, the camera is holding 2 scenes in real time. So this is getting better 'cause you know, trying to before you go started trying to make it more authentic. And that's because you do the same thing. And if you're trying to do it from your own view. So of course, now OK, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK, Basically it's a break. Hold one record 2. It's just active. So let me just stop. OK guys, I'm going to Nigeria for my PhD, but you need to be in Nigeria for my PhD. So you see me in any way an umbrella on the future. Let me see what I've recorded. This I should be recording. Yes, that's recording. So let's start. So my PhD is really on me, myself and I the nature of anthology view of phenomenology as well. So this one just. Started off like my name is Namdi make up Allah. I'm trying to do my PhD but what I am who I am, why am I here in this reality? Basically I believe I'm pretty sure the four dimension downwards and that's how we work. But I already done my ontological intelligence research on my PhD. This is bound to T3A and T3B. Only 60 quicker test. This one I don't know about a dime. Basically I'm gonna try to beat new life. It's into new people. So I'm gonna go to Nigeria, try to give back to the people. Why what they give to me? But AAA, double it, quadrupolis, you know, which is our evil culture away where we are, you know, in Ebola. But I'm the founding act, you know, I'm a founding researcher on anthological. Patient suggests an unconscious systems. If you go to my YouTube playlist Obi Nexus O for Oscar B for bravo I for Indigo N for November E for echo X for X-ray E for. My way to do it. So I have to do it properly in this room. So let me start. I don't set a timer. OK, let me set a timer. I've got one hour to set. Let me just sit for the 5 minutes maximum clock. So 'cause you know, I can use it if I ever do it wrong. OK my timer has started now 3 to 1 started now so go for 5 minutes or to make one video So can you please take out OK see this video then it's now this so guys take a picture of this if you can I'm going to use model now of displaying how we relate to the robot based on myself my position of being the. So see this, this is me. This is a mirror here. So this mirror is like a point in the mirror, a prediction point in the mirror. So this one is a four, three, once a world our time. So we get older as a child, we go older and then we can go have kids. I don't want kids here. So I'm having kids. So I'm a child of infant. An embryo, because of the child, it grows, grows, grow, grows, grows and grows good, up, up, up, you know. But this thing is partial. It's partial, you know, You can't go back. Usually you can't. You can't start from this state to go back. And wine consciousness is a Brewster 'cause you can't. Some kind of a relationship between our dimension and the dimension? Are both of us or below us the 40 dimension which I'm from. Hopefully I'm not crazy. Yes. So the problem is 2 classifieds, subjective reality and objective reality, my social reality. Why do we have oh, why are you conscious objectively? Why would you use what we're doing? You know why we're here when we just processes instructions, You know, why aren't we just like, you know, conscious. What are we? Of the cognition, what we're doing and how we're doing it. What's the purpose of all of that You know that's what ontology is all about our nature, us us us in our being not just one person us entirely no, no, basically the pre control of qualia framework is like. From the goal of this research. So if I go to scene 10 which I am recording scene 10 because I go to repositories. Yep, this one, This is bubble theory ontological. No, this bubble theory ontological is for everyone. Qualia framework for breath life is only about the T3A and T3B. And of course, with knowledge, current power, comes knowledge. We can do knowledge, and that's what we're trying to do properly. We're going. No one dies again, no pops the bubble which I want my people to understand. I'm doing this for PhD. So you charge no charge of a die or starve again. Guys, I'm sick of this happening to people that actually care about. I want to do something. So that's the bubble quality. So the bubble or quality is basically bubble theory, bubble quality, our qualia, our bean for us Ibos only 'cause we're all Ebola, you know, in Nigeria and Biafra Terrace, you know, we're not, you're about, it's not about that. So ontological knowing. Kocher Qualia, Our sense how the relax for us in memory, in time, all of us, all of us ontological and then bubble the membrane, you know the bubble, it's like a plasma system, but we have bubbles. We are stable, we are happy, we are chill, we're not angry at each other. We are bubbles when we haven't seen shell. Two pieces apart, that thing 'cause you know, you can be in a pot without being happy with the sound that, you know, port, you know, without potentially A2 piece in a pot, you can make four piece and that four piece would be sprouting different routes. That's a problem of quality really 'cause you know, we want different interests. We start to get confused. We don't really align with that what we want to do objective and we can grow together. Welcome collapse together. Now I've got the bubble qualia phenomenological now pharmacical. It's like us and them. So we got you both. They are robot or they are robot. We are you both. We know we don't understand them fully because they have different origin ancestry. May we may understand something about all of it. If they don't tell us all of it, you can say. But just just tell us all of it was to just frame it in context. So basically 2 problems. You see, there are four sets of problems, my mind, the phenomenological body, the body, the mind, and so the body, my body, my heart, my physical heart and my my to my. Mine my physical health, who I'm used to love, feel, adore, full type of love cause the agape and I'm not about that anyway. I mean you got a love how to love all of us together love in the nature of being and the nature of being for loving myself. I myself, me, myself and I and loving friends and family. I know, I see, I feel that in my conscience of ontology of pharmacy. Uh, uh, objects right to the state of being conscious. So my 40 conscious knowledge to qualia. So so this is also basically when you look in the mirror here, see that point? That's like a 4D point in space. You got a 40 spatial contract there, but it's a unique looking mirror here now basically. This forty thing, this forty thing is me here. But in this reflection of me in the 4D world, this mirror, this mirror is appointed disappointing the density here that transforms that, no matter how far back I mean, I can also access that mirror. Uh, it's impossible to see this everything in 4 digits and put everything 3D. Everything is umm, everything you can do in 4D or you can do in 3D already, Just you can do it a much more better. So basically every four directly. It's not, it's not all the way around, 'cause you know, you can go if you want to translate the food you have to construct, you have to measure. 4D properties to transition to 40. So if you just make a mistake, you can't align with a 40 cause themselves all the way around. So if I want to go to a four dimensional world, I have to literally know the 4D world ahead of like you know, the 4D world is there, but I can't measure it. I have to observe it, but you know, I have to measure all of. All of the smallest thing about my world and, you know, measures in a way that's coherently stable for me to see it, observe it, feel it. It's like a lensing. Call it lensing because, you know, it's more of a glimpse. You get into the reality. Like I'm talking to you right now OK, let's go on 4D clarification spots now sports now sports definition. Sorry, I'm going to give you this I'm going to go go this video later, but I'm going to give you show you this for now sparse. I should have. I don't. I don't want to. I give it wrong, Give it properly. I don't know. Rush it, Nandi. Sparse definition is very important. You're gonna back it up too. Let me try to do it properly. So you got Oh no no no, sorry. Oh this is mine. Oh sorry, this is my 1 here. Sorry guys. Basically the sparse matrix is what I made to model this kind of change position from the 41 to the two world. I'm going to try to get it out because I'm just calling a lot of people right now, so I'm just trying to get it out here. So right here basically, but I've got it backwards here somewhere. So it's here, and it's here too. Uh, this is very red. This is here now, so just let me see this now and put it here. Umm. Looks right here. It's not here per SE. If you basically said so let's look at it now. Let's be found before I even continue. So let me just try to find it and now turn off the spin. So, OK, let me just pause this. Sorry. It's kind of like skip ahead. Let me just pause this recording. So I find it. If I don't oppose it, I, I don't oppose it, but I don't oppose it. No, I'm just uh, you can, I mean for my sake, let me just pause it uh recording one uh pause. Thank you uh recording one uh pause recording one. Sorry guys just put recording one. I used to pause it guys. OK, Oh, sorry, business recording guys here. So I got through 'cause I'm going E 0. So this is Y00Y1. UH1X1. X1. X1. 0.0 and then one. Y X1. 10100 is Y00. So you got XX0. This is the X1. X1 and Y0 and you go X to 1 and YX0. It's 1, so why 1? So why 1 is this? Why 1 is this so? Why one? And then go Y1Y0Y8. This is a zero or zero that we get Y1. 11010 so it's 01. This is 01, this is 101. Y 101 Y. This is 120101Y10 and 1010 will be a. I wonder if 1E equals E and you get 1 EO 0. You know if you can write to get 010, get here 01. You get 0801011. This is 11121. OK, so guys, let me just record it now, Peter. It's gonna fill it should fill. It filled. OK, so basically that failed now. So let me just stop it anyway, it failed to continue. So I I stopped this right now. Oh, it's oh, sorry, it's continuing. So oh, sorry, didn't stop. OK, I thought you failed me. OK, so basically it's very important to start with this. So these are 4/2 infants are two dimensions minimum to present. Up to the three different, so we saw 2D is to represent 2D cigarettes are four states of 2D component XY. OK, now can you try to do this properly now? So you got a XY only to project up to come to become a policy and Ant to go up a dimension or to observe or have interaction with dimension? Have to go have to construct this table to get it so, so you have to remember so. So it's also for every 001 that starts to go through something called epsilon transition epsilon or two table which one model of A2 table. So I don't really care what we do now. This model is just like a more remember everything which is the bubble. So you get 01 and then that zero is either 0 epsilon E for epsilon 01. So you get from one state and if you go to. As you to the next stage, so you have zero. I have done which could be 1. You get a one and that information has to go to the state machine. So you get the other version. So remember the next state one, let's see one before so one or one becomes one and the output and you then export to store the the minimum information. 01 excluding 10 because zero was the one which is preserved. Nothing was preserved, nothing to spool, nothing in the three world. But I don't want to go through this yet with you guys. Can you try and go through it? So you got A10 so forth and so on for one and 0. So one thing to you guys, this model is called a a. 2 table, I call it a spouse, uh, because, uh, it's a model's order data, uh, and remembers all the states, which is, that was in that data, uh, cause sparsest can, uh, preserve a state and data at the same time, uh, together. Uh, so, uh, if you get to 1 and I want to preserve the one and you want to preserve information first, so you put. First, uh, then a zero. If you want to preserve both A1, you put them two ones. If you put, just put a preserve, uh, of UH-0. First you put a. Only for the 1 you know and 11 becomes 11. Remember all the states this world diagrams based on and this one is very important for you guys to understand that. Now we get the encoding table. So this is an encoding table, same thing as the state but it gives you 2 outputs. You know from coding for classic computation and quantum computation C not gate. So this one's very important too. So you get 0X00, you get to the coding of 0 epsilon, which means no state, no data, no memory, nil. Ontological, nil, nil, anthemological things that are the things that are phenomenal to the work we can see at times. Union, union. So basically it's all operations plus my plus plus and times 0 E epsilon. So basically you can get for if you have two states of 00 between X&Y coordinates. You have to project upwards. You want to go up from. So if you have like a 3D beam like the Juggernaut don't want to go up, they have to protect themselves up a dimension. You can do like a police machine because you can model any kind of projection with matrix without being computing overcomputing. Let me just try that really for now because you know, trying to. Point even I didn't do it intentionally trying to. So let me improve point my point now. So what does this mean to you, For me and everyone else here who actually cares about what I'm doing? Uh, uh, yeah. So so so umm, the including table E epsilon is just nail space of a magic nail. Oh, so fly can fly, man. So. So I'm saying the commercial of nil. Nil means no type, no memory, no value. No means no type, no value. So it means a void pointer. So now a void printer to norm avoid is nothing in the space. So let me try to compute this perfectly with some kind of a prediction of my way so. If I like the standard projection function, you you take axy component and then you transpose it and then you do the calculation on the row and alignment. You know, but you know this is very. Or two or two as you get like a pointer space and time number between 0 and 10, one and 10, so you get Let me speaking about 513 and. 3:00 and 5:00. 4 metrics. That's my position in space-time as an Ant in the world. So just be another one there in the real world in the 3D World. Hope you can see me. So if I'm Ant I see only see my position on XY503. Are there three and five respective? This is my point. In the real world, five and three but. Protect myself, I'll do some kind of rotation so so so so this is the 502 is just my exponent into this SpaceX OY code 2D is five and 3513. Now now, now I want to project myself. So what I do is inverse matrix matrix I do and then multiply by it. So I did the row becomes a column it's called a transpose. SO3 becomes 5. 5:00 and 3:00 so you get a quick. 5 * 3 is no, so you get like on damage to two matches is 1 misses from the version. You should see good transposition of of that version and you multiply it and then you get the identity and then that transpose is five so you do a rule. So basically you take the matrix and then you go row by row, column by column, so you get. 5 * 3 is the row of 15/15/15 what 15 and then 3 * 5 is what 15. So I'm actually a position obviously in seriously if if I see on the center. At the center of something, sense of something. I am basically. I'm basically at 35, my row, my row in the. XYXYXYZ where I am for the learning from reference to a real person that's been projected as a 3D being example. I'm looking at this thing, it's really important. So it's my role rule X root Y. So basically I'm at 1515 in. Have you, uh, already, uh, XY, but you know, I'm saying I'm at a A53, but that's 1515. And that's like what it's kind of conversation 00 to them, this is me to them. 00 is uniform question of five to three. And then just so that's a role. I'm a soldier column, so I don't do the column. So now. If the rule is 5/3. A. A rural column is what, 533? 53UH53UH-35. 5:00 and 3:15 3/5. So this is the column around because the five three is the row and five no. To get the three five 3 * 5 is what, 3 times no. So you get oh so 3 * 3 is 9. No, wait, is it? Sorry, let's try to do it so you get 3-5. This is just the other one. 3/5 No 3/5. For the column or recession you could transport the two matrices and you get to have 535 and then becomes 5 three. Then you get the 3 * 5 is 15 three 3 * 5 is 15 five to 15 so you get 1515. That so this is a identity. So this is the same identity is like my identity between 'cause you know this is just zero to them, zero point to them 'cause it's just identity bound. So basically the zero point will be the the coherent state of the measurement framework. Because the additives metric is just gives you in that phenomenal intelligent phase. Now you have another matrix, let's say 6-3 and seven eight. 78633. The 6th strategy and it's a history, but I keep the same matrix of what 53667 is that and 6-7 and five and then. Of the of myself as a 5 three 'cause I was three. Wait, is it 5-3? I put 359. Oh, oh, this is the uncle's now. This is the uncle's 5/3. This is the uncle's now. 53535, 3, which is the. Element row and then the inverted row alignment is what the inverted row. This you can have up and down and it's. There's no strict up and down South if inverted because 35 when you put in a standard that you don't make a mistake, 35 will be the column. If it's it's an aunt observing that answer, thinking up is down, up down and then the 5335 duality. So it is 2 aunts and three five and and five three go on a 2. Century if they're walking, you know, compared to emergencies, and then they don't know where they're going and they see me, they see me, they see me. And A and aunt, aunt, my aunt, our aunt #5 aunt number, our aunt #5. And there aren't number of. And to be so the same thing just go in opposite directions. Opposite directions now now and a is working at 5/3. 53 but you know we is now becoming up is going to six or seven before 6 or 7 so but you know the the and their hands goes up nuts goes up one like a one unit 2 OK, let's say. 205256727. So they go up to seven, they got one unit especially, so now they're from over 6-7. System 53 so we just keep watching it and five so so we got BBC I was just now store 353535 S we're just watching us we we should we ask 3535. So what was now? So we get the row 6 * 3 is what 16? Eighteen 6 * 3 is 18 now 18 plus something a system 3 is 18 now 6 * 5 no six and three. So the row is what 6 * 3? And the column of the rows 6 * 5 six times 5 is. 20, No 24. 620 four 6 * 5 is 20. Note 2005 is 21 seasons, 4 is 22 * 5 is 24 so 24 and then we do 7 * 3 is 27 and then 7 * 3 is 27 A plus. 7 * 5. 7 * 5. So 7 * 5 would be 35 S Basically I'm observing this system, this aunt, our aunt and our frame of view 'cause our we can download our in our way when we see 18 + 2724 X. Which I couldn't. So basically for my friend of you there it's 910-1112. 128910111212. I didn't get 12 plus 1/3 4:42. Location 42,. 24 homogeneous model 24 + 35 that's 7-8. 9/10/11, 12:12. 12th uh, the 5th, 12th then 12 is UH-23. 3 is a 12 so got the secretary 62 and that's just our aunt, our aunt at position what in our frame of reference, our view it's it's just moved from is recently at position 42. 62 He thinks it's at 5:00 and 3:00. 513 so antics are 53535 question 5 from 5 and 3 means to 6-7 so. This is 70 that's quite good. You know that would be a meme. Now that would be good to me go viral. Thank you for thinking of this example. OK so basically outage is at 6-7. 53 We didn't move from the ads point of view. As point of view, we are just the same place 'cause we are rotated the same place but never moved, we never moved. Ant is 5, three and two out there and we never moved to Ant is 5/3, so 5-3 and then there. Then we go, then we don't move anything so we get a 42. Come on, 62, that's where we are ourselves and we will see ourselves of recently there's there's a great basically obviously goes up to 100 'cause if artists want to 10, the dimension up is 100, you know, 100 dimension. So we get units up, entire units up and that's 1010. We should come back to you later. So with some logic, so our artist there, but you know that's a homogeneous model. Homogeneous. So basically our ants can only go. Basically if our ants have to go to 100, it cannot transcend A dimension. So let's even go to inside dimension and time, it's just a time to be 90%. And up to get one dimension so homogeneous model. So we are at literally at 42 and 57 in our view in the three world 'cause we get like a 10 dimensions to 10. So we get one dimension with the scale of dimension the the the 1D1 point times 10 the 10 telemetry in our world their world their. And then our dimension 100 a hundred, which is units 1 or 10% units, but you know the 40 what I mean, the 40 will be 4D, will be 10 another time will be 100 a hundred dimension, 100 dimensions we can enter we're gonna 100 or 10,000 or so. In the 10/10/10 thousand. 10 * 10 is 100, so basically we can observe basically 100 * + 100 is what? 200 so we can observe the minimum of local, minimum of 200 and maybe just some simple measurement and you know 100 * 100 is what. 00 that's 1 Adobe or 1010 thousand. 10,000. Basically there's a. Basically there's 10,000 from locally become. If in the food you are and you know we can observe which is restriction. This is an IK principle. So that's enough. We can observe, but OK, we can basically be there's a minimum, the minimum system can act on if you can observe it, there's an occupancy, we can observe, we can access minimum, but the capers who can observe it will not be interpreted but as we can see IK there. So this is the key local. How we observe how information is until we get what we just start a new one. I don't want to lose the site, I don't use my system. OK, I just thought you recording 'cause I don't trust my system. OK, OK, OK, so we get the Auntan +1234. Oh that's too serious. They will get 000, two, 10,010 bucks. 210,200 minutes. Oh, we can't measure maximum 'cause that's the union of the whole new system if you do things or properly. So my form of reference is against 42 or 67 in. If I'm 100 dimensions, you know. If I have 100 spaces, you don't. Static system, you know the world is if there's a hundred places can go only, only squares I can go to. This was Swissy. The artist for me is at 4267. So if I go to that and if I go to that and now down to be thinking it's A536367, no, wait 6-7. But I'm, I'm saying, Oh yeah. So I go to six, see that and what? Lives in that square and that 10 units is square, 10 units, 100 units square for my 100 unit square, Great, 100%. So that will be the layer for the heterogeneous model if you agree on a protocol to speak to each other. So I have to get like, so basically for me to, if I want to, for me for 2 / 2, six is 7. 7:00 So I have to go to like if I. My square 00 and social cartesian bound users go to my go to seven six 7 * 6 is 42 and then 62 / 7. Let me go to the calculator. No calculation this hand, only 52 / 7. What about 7? What? Oh, my alarm is done. No, it's not. Oh, 62% is a 8.8571. 4 uh 8.81. 18.857. To three-dimensional places it does 8.58 point..8. 573 decimal places founded. OK, next thing #2 So this is very, very important guys, so let's continue. So that's the importance of this is how it is in our reality. So let me put this down now. I'm gonna lose that. So what is some service? It was different to do the same thing, but you know it's for modeling and coding like a functions. Things down code and run on the fly. But it's past a function of coding a function to come up bidirectionally. So you can have a mapping of a 2 to one functions for every two inputs you get in variability into your reality. The aunt to Margaret. There's a function I can define that unifies them to two to one site. 2:00 to 1:00. Was particular one if it's homogeneous data mapping to one data to a 2. So you can have a 21 function and map it to another function in their reality of time of dimension, that's sparse model that's smoothly sparse. Again, that's a spouse, meaning spouse just means it can be modeled as in in different functions to them. They can have their own function as 2 DI can offer 3D and then once one mapping function using 2 outputs, 2 outputs consider they they. They can then get what I when I when I said to them. What do you know? What do you know about me by dashboard? Two way from two way table from two way cycle of doing some two way to do something. Yes. Umm, so basically I'm trying to do this properly guys uh, OK, SO21 OK, further. So at least he's put down the phone number. OK, so this is the coding table again, the state including uh, this is for for for every scene or gates, you get a queue nugget uh, it's a quantum rift as well uh, so. Next thing we do now this. So I've got my people here. Anything happened? And so let's just try to get a right here. So that's including table again, guys, take a picture of it if you can, and that's fine. So basically, yes. Oh, oh, I just. All I do is nobody. So that's what I'm saying, that it's more about our structure or syntax, but the structure of the information that you're being coherently relaying to the other reality. Oh, this and reactive one. OK, so let me continue with this one. But now I'm picking them nicely here. So this is my work, a nice work here, my PhD because I'm doing APG three years almost so. So basically this thing here is by the way. So let me just give try to stop this video. Oh, the news has not gone by. OK. Oh, it has not gone by, so let me go. So on the soap. So guys, let me just, I can't, I can't get you guys to move this name. I can't. I can't lose it here. I call it this stupid thing. Tell me not to lose this. Call me crazy for a second, even for a second number. Can't be crazy. So this is for sparse graph modeling. Try to model the functions as a directional graphs, not just like the data. So it's into like a. This is about people that can live and die and breathe, you know? Oh yes. This is just for the that's when I started with the the dental umm, Commission here. I'm going to just start with. So basically, uh, see this image here. Uh, you know, guys, very important and style this concept. This was the four year is it's a qualia, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble, it's a bubble. Quality bomb for us now university is a bubble. It could be a square, but you know, it's just the easiest thing to model in the system. So you can get a a bubble or like a point in a 2D in a world at an incident, a place can location go to, you know, can go to detail, you know, but you don't want you can have no dimension to it. Then you get A2 dimension that you know, but that's a circle. OK, Circle is just one dimension. But you know, in our, in our reality, we've got a bubble. So you can go up and up then get whatever the, the, the system, the, the, the time thing is in the bubble. So that's for the mission. So it's a sparse modeling system. So basically time is diluted. In our reality, the this time, but we we get past time, we get only one set of homogeneous time. We can can basically we can we can be observing homogeneous time, but no, it's we're doing hopefully homogeneous. We're not feeling, we're not getting the full sparsity. Tuition to 4 dimensional can't go back in time just naturally in our world, you have to get a time machine to do that. But but we have to go to the the the system measures properly enough in a full reality, which I'm saying. So if time 'cause time is a dimension in this model, you know, but you know it's a sparse dimension and the XY usually if I can go XI can get past X, which can be. Between the 2D world and 3D World, because the I can descend to three world and, you know, comes through it. What is important guys? OK, so my mind I I can see the juggernaut. I can have a thing you can I can talk about chicken. So I try to remember the chicken. I remember the chicken. I have a total of the chicken, but I thought of the juggernaut is like real. It's very good. It's real. So, but that's not a Juggernaut. Why 'cause don't obviously, if the Juggernaut represents an ultimate force, he can run indefinitely. He says the ultimate force, the purpose of doing them. But you know, that's my intake, that's my obsession on him. You know, in the movies, actually, he's a killer. He's a, he's a ****** man. But Juggernaut does not intervene in my real life. Why? Because he's a dead in my head. I can get crazy. I can't get crazy over the Jonah. I can go crazy in a different way. But he doesn't take it from my mind, 'cause he, he, he can take, he, he, he can't, he can't really 'cause he's a piece of he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a fictional. But why is fictional? Because he's a piece of paper. He's in a comic and go and buy a comic and get a good, good junk and read. But the Juggernaut is a force or unstop. Force uh, the stock would juggernaut uh umm. But you know, he's one, he's one I'm the king I'm I'm his controller, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his, I'm his I'm gonna rock. You know I'm dead. I have full power 'cause I'm a dimension above. So you're gonna can never ever take out of my mind. That's what I'm saying. So if he, if he doesn't want to try to be in my dimension, he has to transcend his dimension and, and come to my reality and be with me and see his comments. And then for him to actually take off my, my, myself, my own body just to transfer another dimension and see all my time. On my days I have lived until see how can change my life with money, but I'm chasing myself without you gonna so I'm busy. He can be unstable for in a plane of 2D physics you Marvel Universe, but it's not simple for it in my 3 world, 'cause he's three world is just my length of my three world. A glimpse of what is getting in this world, which is give me a horror movie editing, maybe scary thing, but you cannot make me think of no matter how how, how, how much I believe he's a God, He's powerful. Basically, I'm the immeasurable object in my reality. But he could be in his superfoods. So when a super force meets a dimensional 3 DIY. But you know, his dimension does not force does not cannot what is influence cannot cannot transcend my dimension whatever force users unless IT projects to my dimension at the bare minimum. So basically something so this is what a qualia. So the qualia system is that. So when you're born you are embryo, that embryo contains 23 chromosomes and 242346 total chromosome. Now. Now you get to have the chromosome 1 and sister more than your brother, mother and sister. So you get half the chromosome. But when you ascend, when you get born, when you get into a game, it's a zygote said when you are like a fertilized egg who's called a zygote zygote. So what you gonna do is you insurance half and half, half and half, half my mother, half a sister that just a piece. I got P consciousness phase one I got which is your fertilized first gamut to me. In that example, so for me to transcend I have to have a minimal of 46 to go to to be part of my system that can take me of the mission, I have to double my genomic. Figures all my cells without mutation and keep me in the system so I can go up to my control. Grandfather some traditional 'cause I love grandfather. So this 1-2 mapping. Of this dimension. So if I want to, if it's like a, if it's a 2D world, the act was only 3D. You have to take a half of 23 chromosomes. So basically half of 2 is like half of 23 is, you know, minimum to basically take. How about to a minimum? So this is how 23 is what? Sorry I'm just trying to figure my hand. 1/2 of 23 is 2025 by two, that's 111.5. 2.50 that's 12.5. So for five genes to be a Mariota minimum to 46, maximum no to 4046 * 2. 40 * 4242 or 46 times 2672. UH-45622. To be imagination and be you know juicy to encoding system. So for me basically the the bubble quality shrinks in half where you come from the hub and you can we get fertilized you have to have half of the other dimension if you have 4 dimension and vice versa you have to double. Vice versa a vice versa if you want to go from today, but you know, imagine this you are you are use a bubble in this world. Physical world is a physical bubble. It's hover about the ocean. Oh, but only the ocean because there's water in this air and it's water and air. This water is fully already. It's it's a water and air. It's meant to bridge your consciousness. A boost drop unit. It is here. Did I keep anything hidden? Did I forget anything? I hope not. I hope I didn't forget anything, he said. Oh, oh, oh, 10-8 minutes. I have stopped. Save it now. Let me put my sweet now. So let me stop this recording, this recording one. Oh, it's like Sue's Loman. Let me stop it now. Sorry, no need. This is what's still my I'll Tell You recording. Stopping by. So that stopped OK. So that stopped OK. Now I'm pretty new recording. I'll start putting this now now. So the the the so so the this is half two to two. So basically basically what I have something that dimension I halfway through. Embryo development. I have to double my speed unless I'll be die so so this is only nine months. Pregnancy is half of nine months minimum to become a stable zygote. So I get nine 9 / 2. Half of 9 is like what, 4.5 months? No 3.5 months of being. I think it's a double. It's so a little bit five months I have 46 times or whatever the standard of 46 times, some 2 after doubled, I would have doubled on the sales in the nucleus. That's the 6 * 2 to become stable, that's 6. UH-2 uh, doesn't say, uh, six times. 2 is 12 now 4 * 6 is 4 * 2 is 82. That will be double at 82 kilometers minimum just to ensure stability and so I don't fizzle out and die after then so I can keep moving on. So basically 82. At 3.5 months now for the rest of the month, 3.5 months at least 2 for five months. Which is the 9? 9 so after just keep going full important that's 82 * 2 Sorry, sorry. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no for the 727. It's miss 82 * 2 is 4/4 and that will be 8 two 16164 chromosomes to needed to ensure that that that you know, I am fully able to function. I've got my features, my human being. My physical form already for the nine month stage you can't basically I don't know Basically if I get the maximum, the minute local minimum 104, the local maximum will be 8282 + 104. I get 4 + 6 that's. Six 8 + 0 is 0 and then one is 6 and 18988100 and 8486 minimum crossword. I need to be just be exact and walk and talk. And then be happy I can put some recording guys 'cause it's kind of like to eat on my computer. OK guys, let me just stop recording 2. So stop this recording number. Arnold. U this one. Come on, you stop this recording. Oh no, it's still cool then. Let's do dropping frames man sorry number so stop this. OK now stop now. I could just show now. Let me just back up this transfer. Let me just let me just close.

Show less
I need to carefully review the project files and u
Okay, so this video is probably going to time 
out, but you know, I have to upload the two videos then if it does time out. But this video is 
very important to me. It's I'm really in I don't really care what I am. I just get to my house. 
If I get a house now, let me tell you where I go my life. My right private life, but just somewhere 
guys, the stupid place I'm still in. It's the back garden. But you know guys, I'm still like my room 
there. But I don't want to show you guys that this building that's basically the pipe, the toilet 
stuff, but I don't really care. Um so basically uh this is my uh something I call the breath 
dance you know because I'm eel uh the breath to life uh you have to breathe or the breathing 
cycle the cycle of breath uh dance breathing you know if you live in the constitution you know you 
know I everything you know so basically I so it's for me to enjoy my life a message to me this is 
myself you know it's a new beginning so Mr. Obi where I go now. Yes, I call it the bread 
dance. It's like an ebo man spirit of the masquerade masquerade of the spirit and 
we go uh basically I go not I'm going to dance for you guys. I want to play a song 
uh breathing working. It's like it's like an expressive song. It's got a lot of money in 
it. I'm going to show you some moves of it and then we'll see what you think. Um the moves 
you know let me see what you think of it. Uh but you know uh so it's really from the 
if you go to like medium uh.com uh slop bi can find the poem spirits of the masquerade 
you know and then you got the other poem the other poem a masquerade of the spirits you know 
uh basically the two the duality uh parality uh parality function you know I don't want 
to think about that right now until I dance because I'm really to Nigeria for my PhD. 
Uh cuz you know I get came to Cambridge to suit 40 million pounds and that would be my my 
business account. Uh but I have to make sure I do things properly. So I get to Cambridge all my 
blueprints and everything properly. But you know the internet is getting restricted in Nigeria. 
You know funny enough. Uh but you know that's just normal Nigerian bureaucracy. You don't 
want to do anything better. Don't open the borders anymore because you know they have money. 
bad people have money and we good people have the very poor the very small percentile of the bad 
people um have the biggest power and the you know say polarity system you know it's not fair 
basically bad people have big power and we good people have no just I know in Nigeria you know 
I'm not telling you metaphoria I just know that you know even you have like a breakthrough of 
them you know those people are very good people uh okay so now this is the breakdowns you know 
so I'm going to try to do it but I don't care if it goes viral so like you know So what do you 
have? What's your problem? You look like some kind of injured person there. You know I want to 
go viral but you know I don't really care what it does. You know I only care if it goes viral in 
the Nigeria. So basically um I'mra so bically means come and take. So so I'm to breathe new life 
into your eyes like you know mom did this mean oh my mom. So it's a child this child leg is injured. 
I breathe life into their legs and they can walk. This man has a walking stick. I breathe, you know. 
It's not walking on water, nothing. It's not walk like Jesus. [ __ ] nothing. I'm a scientist. I'm a 
computer scientist. I'm a B drink. I'm not Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. I know who Jesus is. I 
never met Jesus. So, I come my hand my hand break. I bring new heart. It's healed. It's healed. 
You know, it's called a breath. But, you know, it's a new life and building. You know, it's not 
about all the breakthroughs like really for me about the healing process. You know, you can push 
your business model. When system fails, build your own. But for me, it's more personal and spiritual 
and uh cultural and ancestral and historic, you know, cuz that's the most to me. So, I got 
be dancing me blowing stuff, but I have thin air, you know. This one has a problem right now 
in my face. I give him breath. This one has the money. I give money and I give him I give him 
money, but the money comes back, you know, double me double. So, I I give big money. Don't give me 
big money. So, basically, that's what it is. Um, it's about uh healing. Um, I really feel this way 
because, you know, I have a persona, you know, I'm not I'm not a boring person. I thought being bored 
or being cold. Okay, let's play the money song by I want to I want to I want to shove My body first though, guys, my bank accounts ago. Take a look at it like this. If I don't get money to my friend money problem to build everything for myself. Let's 
build the future. a lot. Thank you. Thank you. So cool, man. My bank account. problem. Go for the food. Go for the water. Go to 
the shelter. Double everything for me. I'm calling IQ. Just turn my computer. Send me money. 
Send me my email. Send my bank account. I give you double. Give me double now. 
Give me I give you double money. Give me the double money. I give you double food. 
Give me double phantom tax. You pay your phantom tax. You know phm tax. You know 
I go. I just your go back home. Go back. Come on. Breathe. Breathe. My friends, I miss them. Thank you guys. Thank you. Yes. Thank you 
guys. Perfect. The reward.

Okay. Uh it should be recording now. Okay. Uh click the uh uh uh basically it should be recording now. One second guys. Uh yes uh it's recording. Uh uh everything is recording. Okay guys. So this video means a lot to me. Uh I don't want to write down any more than I did today. Uh but today uh this video is so important. I don't want anybody to judge me. But you know I feel um autistic ADHD asper just in I don't think it's because I believe my um uh um basically I'm going to basically I made my uh legislation uh yesterday. So that's my legislation for the OBS design and constitution uh OA which is public law uh uh public law uh public uh public what OA means public and you see it uh um and then the I J A G I J A G and uh I w that's the public uh related and protested a law constitution uh that protect the most people in society uh like people uh society anymore um with you anyway uh but this is very important with this okay basically I'm 24 years old I'm going to go to Nigeria uh but you know I'm going to rebirth myself as Mr. I believe I am here for a reason on earth, not for God. Don't believe in Jesus Christ. I'm a scientist. But I believe I uh you know I don't believe in Jesus. I never have Jesus. I don't care about Jesus. Um so OB go there. Uh I've got a diploma in computer science and a bachelor uh in what uh diploma in uh uh in uh I believe in business which I can't find. Yeah. I don't care. But you know my whole life focus ontology. Anthology just means um you you you me it's about me uh was looking at uh real world problems and how they affect you uh directly. Uh because that's what uh my all about. You know, I'm really building a constitutional model. But if you don't remember me, uh it's fine. You know, I want you to remember what I did for you guys. So, this is my watch. You see my watch here? You see like a It's never a diamond. This a Rolex. Uh first of all, my Rolex. My mom bought this Rolex when I was like uh uh uh 10 years old. 11 years old. Uh 10. No, I turned uh 10. 10. I was like a new but you know I believe in higher purpose and all higher purpose since my watch is a Rolex a fake one which is crap was new it wasn't like real basically my believe my mom my brother brought it mom didn't want to buy it she just she was my birthday 10 years old she didn't care for my birthday she give me a fake watch this fake was I told the time was working uh you know see the chains the chain chain are jingling you know uh but you know the chains are there this my like if you don't remember this watch and have this place to call a relic. So basically this is my first relic. Uh but you know a relic is just a thing I can hold. So basically when I get this much you know I can sell this watch and sto the time and basically I want to tell the time for you guys. So basically uh 2 to1 marketing you know this like athology. So for me my mom bought this watch and I uh my birthday 9 was in foster care uh 10 years my mom and she don't want to care for me. She says I promutistic EDG asper just learns ability of bipolar uh without but it just tes everything like sources uh later on but doesn't really matter uh everything in the book so I claim that money but no money is not for me it's for you guys so this every time I go out you know this watch falls down it breaks I'm stressed I'm stressed like so basically see the chains they are um they kind of old everything [ __ ] but see this one this like thing here. Uh it's like me present my relic. This is my first relic. Uh I still have it here, but you know I'm thinking of them has changed. So um this like me logo here. Uh see this watch is cracked. Can you see it's cracked? Take look. So it's cracked but you know it's not even working. It's not even take it you know and it's fake. It can't be fixed. So cuz won't take it cuz it's so old. Uh don't even take it and fix it and make it new. So this one saying I'm not broken. The system is so RAM is broken. So I want to take my relic and make it new. Uh so but I can mod this with my business but you know uh this is my first aura uh I sealed. So basically every time I take this watch I wear it inside out inside my like this my persona cuz I'm giving certain amount authentic. So basically it doesn't matter what it means. I'm not broken. Uh this is about time as well. So I put it like this. I'm going to wear this through my put like this. I guess I wear it inside inside out cuz you know it's too big but it's so broken. I don't fit into it. I'm not that big so I don't want to fit into it. So I just wear it inside out. I just if I try to go out right now what's the time? I'm late. I get time on my wrist. Why? Cuz you know it's a relic. It tells me the time but there's no time. The time has stopped. You know there's no time. Nothing moving on. You know we don't have anything new that can fix this watch. It's impossible to fix. You know, I'm building a new stuff. So basically, I can fix this watch myself and renew it. Uh because no one else will uh that's my initiatives uh next initiative. So uh you got the mit, you got the uh information that's from that's the first thing I want to tell you guys. Okay, next. So obviously I'm going to go back do my PhD. Uh but my P is going to last a minimum of three years. Uh life worth uh but you know I'm going to be doing that. I'm going to renewing I believe I don't believe in spiritual world. I believe in a purpose. I'm a scientist. I don't believe in God. I don't for purpose. So basically I believe like you know the purpose I have on earth and this is just to fix um the Nigerian economy but I now see the problem and the whole su I wasn't there to address it directly. So now it's my only chance to address it. I'm 24. So when I turn 24 I'm going to be uh right now I'm - 1 years old. I'm zero years old because I'm you know I haven't come 25 years but 25 years is my PhD 25 years is a new generation so comes out for me gen alpha of bfers gen alpha and beta uh but you know there already gers now uh let me go 25 uh 20 uh plus uh plus what 25 plus uh 25 years has passed so 2050 no basically when was I 2012. So 20 basically generation Z is a 20 basically. Oh sorry my going 2012 2012 plus that's the end of generation Z. So the go plus uh uh plus how many years plus 12 okay so basically to 5. So basically uh 20 2012 + 12 is 20 to the 4. 2012 2012 I don't really care about women guys you know for me this anthology I don't really care uh how my room is uh basically I want to push uh in beer I don't really care about anyone I don't know about this is a new gener you know I think going to suffer if I don't go there and I'm just renewing myself as them so basically uh my avatar is my spirit avatar is them I'm an avatar Mr. But you know I'm obviously I'm a grade but you know my name is Mr. That's my avatar. This is you diver inclusivity network you know that's my business model you live there you work there you breathe there you know you don't need to go anywhere else you know compu it's about stability uh civility I'm rebuild for me I have a computer science I have a diploma I still have a house in the UK I'm a council for me all I want but you know it affects me and affect my personal life you know I look a dirty bastard but you know I look a crazy man I'm not I'm very sane. I I know I'm very sane because this one thing I want to get rid of. Get rid of this thing. I'm trying to say people that are neurody divergent and neurotypical too has to be done guys. You know you guys are not the same. You never get along and so we know why you don't get along guys or how how you know cuz you know you guys are are two different uh kinds of people. Uh so basically uh this is my dragon. You see dragon. Uh now take a picture. If you want to take a picture we taking the picture now. Three two one. This is it guys. This is my uh dragon. Sorry, this is my a bird. This is not a bird. I say this is just like uh what do you call it? Uh my life. So this is like I'm the turtle. I can move slow but I have wings and the wings are flying. So basically uh the muk turtles are the spirit of what you uh the spirit of good and evil. And the zygote is just something that's a child man or woman like you know something that's you got like a a young cat uh a baby cat being born. uh mam something mam has not been born a whale has not been born because that's more scientific than they have carried the wound so we are mammals but we are zygot of m eggs can be m but the chicken egg so that's unborn chicken zy of the chicken so that's what it is so but see this one this one this one is born so that was me I was perfect I could do everything myself but you know I had wings but I was wingless you know I was just walking walking slowly so this is what I want to give you guys so you can do everything yourself perfect but you know you uh wingless, you know. So, I had the wings, but you don't have the wings no more. You can fly like me as a child, you know. You know, that's what I'm saying. I'm going to put the wings wing in the wingless, the the hope in the hopeless and the and the and the voice in the voiceless. Uh you know, cuz I believe in higher purpose uh uh and a higher calling uh than killing people. Uh ontology, the nature of being. Uh so, basically, I'm just introduce um I'm going to go there, but I'm going to calling with you guys literally teaching to you how to crawl. I'm learning some children how to crawl. Uh that's my friends that I missed with the children. So basically my children basically they're going to have um they to crawl uh be crawling uh with me uh children to walk cuz you know if they teach me to crawl I learn to crawl properly and teach me to walk. I learn to walk to talk. So to see how they learn because you know that's more about my people. I don't really care about YouTube. I don't [ __ ] know nothing about see this um thing. You got like a 2D spots. Basically uh if I don't say I'll never say it. Uh so basically um my brain uh basically if you have a 3D uh sparse matrix um anything if you're fully in a 3D reality you are what uh using a 3x3 matrix. So you have the same problem for 2D matrix I have to prove it now because you know I just think that I have to prove it you know. So I have to do it properly. If I never do this I will never do this again. And I don't I only want to do it once. You got to try it yourself. I don't want to be doing again. So, so I'm trying to do it here. So, so you know 3x3 matrix 3 * 3 you get six uh six 9 sorry 9. But if you do 3 + 3 you get uh six six. So what this means you get like six minimum dimensions 3x3 or what? 3x 3 n dimensions. So 6 + 9 is what? Uh 15 dimensions of what? Uh dimensions uh that's pass. Now that's pass relationship is not fully that's the world you live in. But that could be mapped to a 2D world. So basically that 3D eyes can be 2D 2D 2D perception. Uh but you know that's the do now. If I don't do it now you guys never get it. So you know 3D uh that mean 15 dimensions you get uh in the real world you know in the real world uh you know just uh because you know you got three minimum 15 15 maximum so you're going to just say 15 maximum but you go to remove your move this bally 3D or it's just why I don't control 15 dimension only call control my dimension 3D that's there but it's 15 dimensions maximum if there is theoretical uh and then what I'm saying to you is this you If I want to perceive the real world I have my own dimension my mind but my mind is 7 * 7 basically I get like seven dimension uh 7 union 7 union 7 maximum so that's 7 unit 7 * 7 is what 7 + 7 is what uh 14 now 14 7 * 7 is 49 and that give me 63 uh things I can control based on my sensory eyes nose mouth but you know there are six senses what I observe what I control what I observe, you know, I can interpret while interpretation layer uh the GSI files, you know, uh gossip uh gossip uh gossip programming language uh interpretation files, you know, for poly systems and then the GS files, the gossip language, you know, uh basically the interpretation is for policies interpretation and full system cover, Python, C, Rust, etc. You can have that, you know, if you're not important policies in um the GS GSI files, you're really [ __ ] up system for yourself. Uh now uh now uh 49 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 13 13 now four five six. So basically goes into three dimensions you can act on uh bas. So CC is a uh so basically this three world this uh 16 dimensions just what normal neurotypical normal people have normal uh neurotypical people have people not just like you know awkward you know but I'm extruding ordinary so I'm going to try to prove that uh now so we got 62 dimensions and now we got uh 7 * 7 so we got 49 we got 63 dimensions you know uh just the minimum the minimum uh life work breath uh segment so you live you have to be have to work and breathe in a dimension you have to have like a century in this kind of 3D world uh which is what uh 16 to 3 What? 15D the 3 to 15D uh 15D method. I'm using protected for another plane a 4D plane. Uh I'm just going to try to frame myself only and end this video. Uh before I continue this video done a long time ago. Uh so uh minimum minimum 16 uh to 16 union uh 15D 15D uh where D is a dimension of the unity uh union and district for the neural brain brain because you know uh you know that's is sensory uh sensor you have um 63 human rights uh by default in condition you know minimum who can finally take this past you if you can even get the minimum that they kind of kill you killing your ability to do Okay. Uh but you know your 15 dimensions is just uh for not 13 15 dimensions quantum field that's my model. We got 15 dimensions in quantum field. So we have to explore all the dimensions with all our sensors you know uh based on what we can control and we can't control uh for quantum field theory. Uh but you know my so that's basically five to seven uh for the worst neutral people that's five uh can only observe five dimensions. dimension they can't really see anything take anything in if they don't have the dimension scene the blind seven they can't really take in seven that mean can't really whatever they saw uh which is duality there you know I'm talking about that myself only so I believe I am uh in the dimension of 17 to 14 uh I'm so sensually I believe I'm like you know if a double 7 plus 7 is what uh 14 so I can control all my dimensions I have like a a strong of my mind. I can see what what could see uh if they let me in, you know, but I need consensus, you know, uh my cons. So uh so you got like 14 uh * 14 uh which is the maximum senses. So 14 + 14 uh so calculator uh 14 * 14 try to do 14 uh equal to 196. Now 14 + 14 is equal to 28. So that's supposed to broke uh doesn't mean broke. I wish I broke the box. Even though you diver people, that's my but don't care. Basically, I'm no I feel I call myself new flexible. I'm so flexible. I'm not divergent. I'm just myself existence, you know. Uh so we got 6 8 + 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14. Now we get uh 44 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 and then 20 224 dimension uh units. I have the dimension to the four I can control to 63 because I believe my mind is four dimensional. So I'm aware of my state and state who I am where I'm from. So basically my mind is 40. So I believe I'm being projected to 3D world for a reason for purpose to your world. Uh but you know it's just my proof you know I'm so I can see stuff people don't see easily. I can pick up stuff that people don't know of and uh but you know I use my mind to do that. uh what's my problem of mind control basically my mind of a matter product you know if I have all control of the mind I lose all control of the body but you know that's what I'm saying it's just like that you know so you don't want to die so it's just like the mind you know you know mind state of the body you know sobody all the consciousness you know that means they're dead or alive and they're being polarized So uh one more thing guys here to um this is my thing of riches fix Nigeria constitution have a life but you know if you see in dimension you know one day you see me oh this is uh you know I'm busy dimension four dimensions the four dimension which the higher plane but the high plane is not the goal here me going back to that plane is not the goal uh the goal here for me oh time Okay, let me not end this now. Let me end at 30 because I said the time for me to show try to make you know bring up a new flexibility people myself as a child myself. I'm trying to figure out how this why people are keep them. Uh they have five they can do their own things. I don't really care. I want the best life ever because if I ever stay in that dimension uh I want to return to my constitution what I do you know why I made for the people that actually care so I I know uh I know I return to not to Mar but to the soul and the soil bly not the soul not the source like you know the sand the place from returning the which is of from which is from the heart so basically I'm going to give you back twice double you know from the I give you one. That's what I have for you. I'm going to give you two. That means I have double. Don't give you guys uh two uh tological sovereignty concentry and we walk with you. I will learn to walk with you guys uh your children but you know um heal us all change. I I there's no consent. You have consensus in the world. You uh basically the consent is I don't like it. I consent. So if I consent to something and you say no. Uh do you say I don't consent to it? You know it's just too rigid. So do you consent to me using your phone number? No. Uh do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. Uh oh that's fine. So basically uh I've now per said yes once. So um the consent uh is just wrong. Consent once forever. Uh so that's wrong. So that's consent done. So no consent to my phone consensus. Now consensus means what you get. Do you consent to using your phone? Uh yes. Do you consent to me using your phone? No. Do you consent to me using your phone? Yes. So two yes. Yes. Are you using your phone? One. Yes. I'm not sure. So that's a paradox there. Uh consensus paradox. I never consider using my phone unless they are um uh know what they're doing on my phone. I can't view my uh uh bank account inside my data when I use for life. I didn't want to touch my phone even uh one more thing journey to face. So I I'm going to do my schedule B this year. Uh I'm going to do uh J basically basically let me just try with the work guys. No no no this work. No, no, no. This work one. Sorry. Sorry, guys. I'm thinking of the work one here. It's very dirty, guys. I look dirty, man. I'm not so 14 to 2 to1 ratio. Uh 14 human rights seven. So, basically going to have the maximum of expression and that includes your uh your standard human rights seven * 7 or 7. That's just like your shout out uh for living. Uh living just uh basically you're going to have like a 2 to one mark. So you get like a 2 to1 mapping. So if I have a 17 to 14 to 7, that's like two human rights. So one, but I can live and breathe. I can live and breathe. But I cannot work. So if I want to work my my after 28 uh like 7 plus 21 to uh 7 uh so I can work a little bit uh not optional. Uh if I want to work as optional to work to work, but I want to opt into work. uh uh that's 247 to to 7 which is a 3 to1 ratio human right uh thing you know I don't anyone working in the position I want you guys to enjoy life uh so not for the population because you know I want to join with you guys too uh the culture things I missed when I was in UK maybe have a girlfriend I don't mind so here basically this is me Is there any thinner forly? Uh yes, you see this is not the one I brought the wing one. So basically I am not broken system is so I have wings as a child which system never let me use my wings. Uh so basically the wings are uh this is a butterfly a dual mock. So if you can interally beauty this could be a butterfly or water turtles. Uh but turtus just flies on the has wings when they want to fly. Uh the butterflies on the battlefield. So if once fly do I have a turtus and the turtles will be able to fly because two ones you can be um flexible uh like me flexible flexible uh the world divergent is banned so uh before I continue I'm going to ban so basically these are a lot of things happen in the world I'm basing the entire UK economy from my constitutional model um you know because you know they can can build their own they can build their own constitution uh but you know the the pattern spike in four years. Uh that's 22,43 because they indirectly supporting um just me 2073. Uh it's just because it's four years 25 plus 24 is what uh 73 years uh US Brazil 73 because you know Brazil you know the slave choice. So you go from uh British to B of B of Benin and the B of Bin will be uh south the coast of the coastal areas uh where you can get away with this easily and from coastal ed basically it works for them because it's just so rigid you know fixing their framework but you can break this framework strangler it's like the unholy trinity cuz you know cuz you know it's like and I call let's call it unholy because I don't like to call this the triangle the trade of slaves So it's unholy unholy act of training only he works at them if he if he can invert this invert this model and make make it work for us because you know can they can come from the top uh and uh from Brazil and then to Nigeria but that will not work for us because you know we just leaving just leaving them uh it will break for us too we have nothing to give them but you know so the only So this model is called the training and you know this one saying the work for themselves you know the anyone that's colonial and feel that the other should oppressed and the press and the UK uh America what south and north I know uh America's old battle of business I don't trust you guys Americans uh Nigeria uh so this is the slave you go from British the British go Korean people, but they go port security now cuz you know I'm not stupid uh everything but you know get drones based on the m turtles and dragons uh 221 topology. So they come here they sugar plane they take resources uh we take resources and take some slaves to work for them. We work for them. We go we then get deported to what uh America, South America. We get the sugarcane plantation fields. We start planting cotton which is woven but not return to the people and the cycle continues. Uh so this is just a one way thing. This I'm trying to break guys for you guys for all the black people. So uh by rebuilding the infrastructure like I'm saying the it works for them because this this is topology. Yes. But you know things advanced but they can it's not really flexible. It's just square and rectangle. you know uh I'm not going to give any u anybody uh any ideas I don't like anybody uh using any ideas of this um uh but you know I just like use triangles as circles see so basically they are just neurotypical or new diverg but just more flexible like me I'm not you can switch okay I want to go here uh to Nigeria uh let me go there but I'm a square I'm riid So I go my way and they force the policies with the triangles. Now the triangles what can do the same thing but they don't need a square. So basically I can go by myself. Columbus what we know they can go the squares the squares can go square to square square and then go across the border and then come here and come here and then say oh take our resources take what we want and we take then we say oh yes now we now work those place you know because it wasn't about racism it was about the Russian was like power of the future future of power you know the power future and they was their mind was so they don't want to see potential they didn't believe in power they believe in power so they wanted to see their so they so powerful so They didn't want to ally with us or work with us. You know, that was wrong. But we were happy. We were too we were weak. We were weak people. We weren We just tried to um get ourselves uh get ourselves we went basing off. So we were just um so we were so basically the they have a box they have the boxes the boxes or the ships and they put someone that's circle like me so flexible. I hate that guys. New diver flexible logical flexible divergent. So I'm more flexible than all you get because I'm in a position myself. So they put me in the shape and they take me or you know you know in the ship which is circles or many of us in circles. We didn't want to go there. So we then went to the uh we circle we get a circle in the box. We move back to the UK. So some of us in the UK today are still suffering and um crying. Uh what you know the simply can basically the squares the ships can do the same thing. So the ships are bridg so you can think of the ships as this model here. So this like a house. So you see the triangle it's a house. So that's the box I'm in. But it's not my house. It's just getting worse and worse. So that's going to give you. So you get like a so you get like a a pentagon and that pentagon is a house. What happens again is what uh this box I'm in. So this what reminds me of guys uh the two rigid rules. Uh so basically the the GSI uh the GSI files are meant to protect everyone uh from this kind of rigid system. I mean this room I mean uh but you know this like the boat so it's like two widgets. So like a boat it's like a canoe and it's same thing uh bridg frameworks. I hate it. U that's why we have the gsi uh inter dual execution sparse. You can you can have two ways to do something. Uh but this is two two ways. So this one I'm trying to break from you guys. So bally I'm all a circle. So you can work with them definitely. But you know I fe my cards. I'm so proud of it. Uh you know I don't like this kind of so my constitution. I didn't want any uh corners there. Uh I don't stuff. So for me I was in this room and I see a problem here. It's a corner. me. Uh, but you know, cuz I've been in there for so long, I it hurts my head. It's breaking one of my human rights in my head. Uh, that's like one of my sight. So, I'm looking at this corner in my mirror. I'm like, "Fuck this corner. [ __ ] this room." There's no here. Basically, this um this sensing stuff here. I'm seeing this. I'm seeing I'm seeing myself uh angry and sad, but you I can't I don't want to yell because that's not how the rules work. I have to break the rules. Um, you know, I have to break out of my clothes. I have to recover myself. I have to be the wheel. I have to stay perfect. I'm really perfect. I know. I'm angry. I'm screaming and shouting and my senses are overloading because they're over underwhelmed. Basically, they're underwhelmed. Uh, overlay with negative stuff. There's negative and there's positive and uh so that my senses now is like is too uh uh white and black. boring, too boring. Uh it's just not it's not stimulating. It's like a violation of my uh dignity. Why? Why I believe in my right to create with my pen and paper? Maybe freedom. Uh but you know, I'm thinking about 14 human rights. You know, I shouldn't be in this room by law. I know my 25 program specifically. I'm leave now to house. I didn't get a house. My first human right going to get out here. If I come out there for so no corners in my conution if I can put corners just be like two corners one corner you know one to one to two corners and that be the maximum I put uh and then second will be UI for UI use a principle every time we curve curve curve curve UI curve you know sometime looking at squares boxes uh the second human right basically this human right uh human be sight hearing hearing No, I can't hear nothing. I can't even hear the music. But music is what I love. I love music, but you know, I want to have music that calms me down for my mood so I can um be authentic and do my work and relax. Uh this this is dirty stuff. You know, I want you to just no stress. You know, I have the music go up and calm me down. And the third sensory uh broken is like sight. What do I enjoy doing? So my sight uh nose uh music sound uh sound ears sound my I want the food you is boring. So boring, you know. Uh nothing. Uh just chicken and chips. You pay chicken chips. Uh they pay the same price for the chicken shop. Indian shop, the Indian shop. Same price to the Indian shop. Chicken Indian shop. Unless you're going to have a nice meal. The fourth one, the four, five, six, seven, eight. Uh here one. So the sides, the smell room is mess because you know is the game room messy. But you know So cold, but it's also bad outside building, you know, but it's much worse. It's confined. It's not It's not confined confined to this. And then the five one is what uh sight small taste I touch. I'm touching stuff. Yeah. My piece of it feels like boring. I'm not wear anything that I can anchor my soul. my logo remember the six I'm perceiving all of this my six senses I'm intaking all this my intake of my I'm like I'm so angry but you know I don't want to show my um you know I start fidgeting so right now in my head but you know you don't know I'm fixing my head I'm making this video calmly because I've learned to just walk past it but some people can't do it can't do it so because they don't like it the seven is what uh the own uh rest of expression for music and stuff like that. Uh it's really so when I try this uh it's not right it shut me down uh saying you have a room you have a box but today today the box is not so break uh I need to break this framework so that's seven union seven union matrix 14 * 14 you have the right to be alive and work and breathe but you know you're going to have to express yourself that's 14 to uh 14 to 20 21 uh and that should be that should what get no at the bare minimum you can go anywhere and feel included you know uh so you're going to have like a smoker place you know you know going to have all the things that make people never break you know fidgeting your fingers you know arty cars so you have like a pie so that's what I'm So this is uh so basically uh systems. Okay, I come to um complete this now the daytime or the first. So uh this one's here. So that's the 21 the one resource for your expression life work breath breathing you most stress that's one uh 21 to 40 211 please let me know where you come from maybe you're from another dimension uh this normal sport model so this like my guys uh oh what time oh 35 minutes is fast oh no it's fine so let me let me try for you stop this video is So this one has got so you got the one two one to one two to two one. So this is by three uh in the morning I'm breathing in the in the one in the morning I'm doing two things and then the next in the afternoon. So that's morning afternoon evening uh morning 2a 1 that's for the morning one 2 so life I mean work and breathe life work for you guys. So when you breathe Um you know you have to understand that thing is so we have 12 hours a day uh because when is the night is a day it's not in the world that's like the the it's not it's like a so that means the military time is just 6 hours uh so our model of six gives six hours a day to work uh to do your military stuff you know uh that's half a day uh you try to maximize the work on a day uh today uh that's just how it is uh uh in our country in my model uh in the constitution. So this is part model to ratio. So every time I do two things in the morning I have one other thing I'm doing uh in the in the morning uh so in the morning I do want to do two tomorrow so it's positively um I get in the morning uh so basically I get um 6 hours is half day then half half day uh I mean half I mean the day for work is I get 6 hours to do anything I want a day uh then all day other six hours which uh then you get um that's just for breathing so if you get six hours to work six hours to play to brea uh but you know You don't want to split in two because you get fragmented. So you get to get it to your your so to half the day of six which is a three. So you get three hours to work and do your work properly uh you get two to one. So for the when you're working you're going to put two and two uh two work and work and life in one section and breath breathing force you get like how do 12 minus uh three is what? Uh 3 8 uh 12 - 3 uh 9 11 gives you 11 hours to do uh anything you want to do. Uh no 12 10 11 12 12 9 12 12 11 10. You get 9 hours to do anything you want to do uh in the day when you do job complete. Uh so you can you know 9 hours a day is like better than um sorry so 9 hours is better than uh other hours you know uh so that works usually uh one 1.5 to six uh it's just half day uh so just 30 days so you get a quarter of the day uh so you get like a quarter 1.5 hours uh which is 3 hours half one and a half hours uh uh one and a half two to three hours probably get this uh that's one that's one of the day One of the things is what uh if it's half day uh that's just for breakfast. So breakfast, lunch 3 hours and 6 hours the whole day and you have the other days to do anything you want you know. Um you know guys you have to squeeze every little aspect of the day. So but how this work in practice guys. Uh so you can allow that 15 or so this is really better for assist your model now guys. You know guys, never you have to go another day hungry in your life. But you know when you are working, you're working in your backyard. You know, you have to work in your backyard. You know, you don't have to go to the farm cuz you're going to have like a hydro juice model. You basically going to have like a going to have a place you can cook food. Uh but you don't have to go to the food bank. There's no feation of this all the basically I'm trying to squeeze a little um squeeze everything that's rigid out of the so this is your back garden you know you have the garden uh you cook it it's repaired it's processed and you eat it you know you don't have to go to anybody's house you don't have to go uh what you want potatoes uh or chips chicken chips you know you know that's why you have to supply but the gross is is there soil is there and it's warm and it's good and the sunlight no but you know just natural sunlight all the worst things and there's no chemicals in it no it's just decentralized you know there's no need for fertilizers because you know just means you are getting old you don't have to fertilize the land to rush the process because you know it's just natural garden you know just turning sprinkles and the sprinkles will go uh so how to what so basically I'm trying to move all this uh from what I do what who what as architecture so this is infrastructure right now uh but the architecture is just what the architecture is just silicon so uh basically go to blueprints there's a structure so if I say proof if you go to my github uh.com/obex uh patatterents or go to uh my YouTube link uh YouTube uh page YouTube.com access and click uh and click what uh more link you see the GitHub uh repository uh but the half day 1.5 days just you eat breakfast eat breakfast uh breakfast is done in two hours two not two hours you get you know just like a 1.5 hours just done down done just the green zone green zone just to green it's not over so if you're in a green zone and you have one one minute 1 minute 1 second ahead of you are in the red zone. So, but you know that red zone is just to green but you know that becomes a new active zone. So, you need to move to the new active zone. I'm saying so basically your day is going going you go to the red zone uh but you're not waiting for the red basically the time is taken uh in accordance to how you work it's a it'sological it's a time uh so this code m for mother for mic u for umbrella k for kilo or for oscar uh dash dash u for umbrella or or c for uh uh consensual That means time uh UC time because you know um UC time is just uh C or CU time you know so U is for like you you who you are for people uh that division and C is for consensual priic time that is partial uh in let me show you now have like a deck red you This is one. So this is the real model. So this is the model of travel. Uh this is not prove that it works. Guys take a picture guys. So this is uh take a picture of this guys. Uh now now see you working guys. This is so this is you. This is the time someone's watching you like you know this is council. I'm watching you guys. This a centralized note. I'm not where you are. You have 12 50 miles to get to council. Uh 50 miles to get to council. But you I want to reduce this time for you guys all the time. So it's not. So this one is a one and a half day. Okay, one and a half day. Uh you say your morning uh you want to basically uh what I put here is a variable uh that is a pi. So basically uh pi r² is the area uh you're trying to cover uh basically area to time. So you can use 2 pi r which you know uh 2 pi r perimeter but the area you have to cover is the thing you get. 2 pi r just the parameter of the the range of the travel. I need to do p r² using what the area uh p r² times 360. So basically uh let me use calculator again. So I get 15 miles to what travel uh but I live somewhere very far uh in the center reg uh you're going to have like the the biggest one uh two type of council you're going to have like but don't worry about that guys uh 15 miles to the center of where my my in my circle uh place uh sp my morning at exactly uh uh uh when I wake up at uh 1 hour 2 hours 1 to 12:00 let's say uh uh let me do it uh uh 8:00 a.m. I wake up and um 8:00 a.m. wake up and that's my time. It's 8:00 a.m. 8:00 a.m. Let's say 8 12 let's say 8:15 let's say 8 uh 83 a.m. That's the time. Now that time goes in the equation naturally because it works in the ratio model, not the standard model of the nonsense people that make uh 8 8:13 a.m. Now the space I have is the area. So I can work this out by hand. You know it's working by hand. Let me do it by hand. So at 8:13 a.m. I get dressed, I get up, I get uh to the 15 uh meters cancel. 50 miles is a constant 2 seconds. So uh for the perimeter the area to cover is what? Uh pi r². So the pi r² duality uh uh so basically pi is 3.14 let me try to find it to go to sorry guys don't don't distract me pi pi okay pi uh that's pi uh r the radius of the cover is 15 uh you know let's put uh 15 uh miles uh let's see let me try to calculate 15 miles on my uh calculator here uh now I get uh oh is it still recording I don't know uh I think it's done this one uh no text okay let me go uh 15 miles uh 15 miles to uh 15 miles uh 15 uh 15 miles to uh so basically the area basically I can work by Russian say the area is what the area basically 15 acres of land is what 15 acres uh no 15 acres 15 miles no basically this 15 miles is what the time so I should basically doing it wrong now so 15 miles is the distance and that should be the perimeter equation I'm So 15 miles is what? Uh 50 miles is 2 pi r. Uh so the constant part is what? Uh time 15 miles* 15. So this * 15 uh here is the 50 m I get uh pi * 15 is 347 uh.12 uh for 7.123 88. Basically I take the 88 to carry. As I get one, two, three uh because late uh four uh one two three uh pi pi 15 uh 15 is what 3.14 * 5 is 4.1 and this is pi r now * 2 now * 2 is what * 2 is 94 94.2 477. So that's what the uh the the par the parameter uh of the time in which the time uh this called a piewise model. So the peace wise model is just like you know uh you know like you know it's just uh time. So it's sparse relationship model it's pass you get like if if x is even uh if x is even uh print uh uh if x if x if x is zero if x is even uh if if x 2 is zero uh then x is even and if x else if x mod 2 = 1 then print uh um uh force this is like a prime it's the same thing uh but it's just hierarchical so it works on the same principle uh so you get like two one two functions mapping to the state uh so the the the perimeter have to travel like 94.5 miles to get the center so That's not right. So, uh, so basically I don't want this to break. So, I know I don't build it this way because I don't wake up at 8:15 to go. Basically, this 95 4.5 there 4.2 457 is bigger than 15 miles to travel. Uh, it's not zero. Zero. So, I have to get it on time. Uh, so it's like not right. Uh, so let me think again. So if I then train it to like 10 like two mile let's say like um five miles five miles 85 to 5 miles I'm trying to do it properly for you scared of me uh cuz I'm really small 8* 5 oh sorry uh the perimeter 85 pi Pi * R pi * uh 5 miles uh five is what? Uh that's 15. So this 15.7 miles just say 3.5. Uh 3.5 should be the one. So let's use just to make give good example a example. Shut up. J keep quiet Jan. Oh my days. Uh quickly 15 uh uh so if I want to get there uh if it's 15 miles uh I want to get there on time uh I have to ensure that you know it's not over the space of 15 miles. So like this you can try to get 15 miles uh for the perimeter but you know let's say uh it's 2.5 miles to travel uh now uh and uh the the maximum to get there is 5 miles 5 miles 2.5 uh 2.5 miles times what? So pi is what? Uh pi 2.5 miles of pi. Uh and then times what? Uh so the radius squ is what? Uh so radius square. So if I have to travel like a 5 miles that be 10 10 miles of travel uh times what time 3.14* pi. So what will I get there? So I get there 31 uh take me 31.4 miles to travel. Uh if it's just 2.5 miles I'm going. So this never walking distance, you know. So I'm trying to get to never walk uh over 45 minutes. So let's just do the other one. So let's do again. I don't want to get it wrong because I just made it properly. I got the mind. So I want to travel um 2.5 miles* what? Two. That's the radius I'm working on. That's when I'm going to go to center. Uh * 2 that's 10. Uh two that's four. Uh so I get four. So 2.5 radius. Uh uh we just uh 2 2 pi * pi plus pi uh so that's just uh time pi time pi that's 98.69 And that's a par that's just the parameter. So parameter is 198.6 if I get 2.5 miles to travel. Now if I 86 has a polar form. So so if I get the same pi r squ so the radius is the same thing. So is now 2.5. Now squ is 2.5 squ. So let's do another 2.5 squ is 6.25 6.25* 25 times pi time pi that is 19.63. So the rad the area to cover an area of uh 96.3 uh 96.3 to uh to the ratio of to the ratio of um 96 uh this the area. So the area is so basically the area uh this is only ratio 26 this is a fraction 96.3 98 basically 19.6 is just the uh area uh I have to cover uh sorry no no no that's the that's area but this area is just not where I'm from not from my frame of reference so this 96 uh 96 19.63 area to 98.9. So my basically now I get the uh pi r². So now I get the opposite form. So the government basically if I'm if I'm if I am from observing standpoint I get this one. So that's so 19 is the area and then the other one 18.63 is area cover uh if 5 miles uh uh 2.5 miles uh and then uh 8 is the perimeter. So this area this parameter uh so now one more thing I have to do so uh I have to do so if I'm literally uh trying to find uh the center the center as well is computable for me center is where I'm going to so the center is somewhere that's so basically now say uh that's that's the center of thing so where am I going to where am I from I am 15° within uh okay I Um let's say I am uh uh uh for the sake of this I'm 45 degrees uh for 60 that's the location of that polar plane uh polar because it's a circle it's a circle uh so I do 45° 40 uh so basically I do uh 40 uh 360 divided by 45 and that'll give me uh me going uh going right you can do minus 45 but that's just because you know this is that gives me So now 8 * uh 8 * 8 * what? So 8 * what the area? So let's write 8 * the area 8 * the area of 9 18963 uh 1 9.63 guys. That would give me I have to travel easily. Uh because I have to travel like uh from the area of uh uh 157 uh uh one five7.04 4 two two two two two two two 98 uh so theally you get like you know 19 that's just a default the iota for this so now the for the area to the circumference uh is 2 pi r so we now do the other one 98.09 98 9.09 9 uh 2 pi uh I don't do I do uh let me click like so if I'm into the circle I let's just say 5 cm 5 m let's say uh uh 2.5 miles I look at 2 miles 2 miles I'm just 2 miles away uh no 2 miles not 2.5 miles less than 2.5 uh to travel. So that should work. So if I put two times two miles two miles is the the perimeter. So two miles I'm here. So basically the ratio is just uh 45 uh to two mouse. So that's just X and Y uh rotation polar rotation. Uh my where the position is my center cancel is where is pass where the can move uh the data can move in this fast way. Uh so I'm mov I'm moving the uh so basically I have to get the um 2 miles uh shut up thinking sorry uh my voice uh radius squared two. So that's 2 miles of travel uh for the parameter. So 2 m is what uh pi r. So 2 * pi uh is what? 2 * pi is what should be in the frame off I get two * I put uh that be four times uh that is 6 6.283 2 8 3 1 That's fine. Uh 2 * 5 and then the R. No, no. Yes. Uh no, two pi. Sorry. So my r is 2. Uh my arm is what? Two miles. So that be two miles. uh let's say 3 let's say uh uh two miles uh traveling I'm traveling with 3.5 minutes maximum so I have to squeeze that in 3.5 miles 2 miles I'm traveling uh then times what uh time uh time pi * 3.14 uh pi will be 2 pi * 2 pi * 2 uh 34 * 2 no uh pi * 2 pattern is what? Uh pattern 2 6.28 uh miles of travel uh you know um then I get uh you know that's two miles is too much uh travel um uh 2 miles 2 miles is 2 and then you get times r now times r have to be uh 2 miles but you know 2 miles is too uh uh uh long because you know 6.5 miles so my right area. So basically I can't be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Basically there's no reason for neighbor to be where they norm to be in this place and I can check that with my computation. So 2.5 miles is what u 2.5 miles to the count. So I need less than that. So you can see it only cost me 15 miles but you know 250 m but you know that 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3.2 two eight miles is less than 50 miles of a of a small constitution uh for for basically that's a compound complex model anyway but you know I don't want to break that yet so is this correct on my I'm just give you more precise you know so it's basically my already declared my as a policy is 15 miles so the time basically for the area I have to go uh 15 I have to get um for the for every uh for me if I'm at location uh 45 uh which has an area of 45 uh uh precise area uh more accurate or precise model uh area for me is okay precise because I I'm there already because it's not more people it's just me me there me myself and I and I am here and it's a two two for me that's model that matrix two matrix two ratio so uh two I can allow to travel that's the that's the parameter I am uh I can go without cutting corners uh straight uh that would be um two so every area for every where there's a uh basically for every area there's a there's like a parameter I can go past uh can go past people like a community or some I can go uh that's 14 to2 uh but for every now that's the thing only circles only circles there's noation no you get the same time you guys 42 is my frame of reference is where my frame of reference uh uh my frame of reference to get to the place uh to the council which is 15 miles now that If I start at uh the uh xy coordinate uh which is located at uh no so we need to journey 42 42 miles no is it 42 so 2 miles 2.5 miles 2 miles we should join the journey in perimeter and the area which covers the area get the cover is 18 and you tell me otherwise So that's me uh me me where I am in that space. Uh but the council where I'm going to the council is pass. So I can go 2 * 4. So what this is me uh what 0 0 I'm just static. So 0. So it's just 0 0 nothing. Uh nothing. So why I'm doing this 19.6 So I can cover an area of 19.63 uh two no uh yes as a canical iota state you know I can just residing that area being do nothing uh I'll just be okay there be stable uh food water shelter uh uh uh two uh uh 98.6 n so 19.32. So that's the area I have to cover uh for the whole area for the whole people that there uh that work in that compound uh compound which is a complex by the way uh if it is that way uh to live in harmony and that that that one will be um for everyone. So that's me everyone. So if I want to go to my council uh if I do have a problem I get the center and that center is where the center is 0 reference. So say oh if they call me I don't know the reference there the center so the center of ABC but there's no center because it's all relative so everything is in a circle uh relative I don't see an edge in my life uh circle so relative. So that's relative of time. Uh so that's you go to uh github uh uh.com uh/ob nexus uh m u k o d c time I'm going to move that to you time uh c time consensual time because it's your time they're taking it's not there it's going to call you for job uh uh give consent uh so Uh this is second one. Uh I don't really want this. So this is model done. Uh let me go to the other video today. Is it about 16 minutes? Oh 1 hour. I have to trim this video. Okay guys, 1 hour. Let me take you. Thank you very much guys.

Gentlemen, welcome back to my video. Um, now this is a followup video. Um, sorry, I just switched context. Uh, something important came up here. So, uh, now let's just, um, make this video today. Um, I hope it's not echoing because, uh, this is one. Uh, okay. So, firstly, I'm going to talk about, uh, alien hospital. Um, because I'm going to lie everything. I'm going to be make it easy, uh, for people to, uh, grasp. Uh, you know, this is a video. Um, uh, they're going to lie. Um so I have to provide all the evidence by video as well and this is for me as well mostly for me. So uh let me just remove this oral shield but you know I have to just take it off for now cuz this just have to be uh off uh for now. So this is Ellien Hospital uh metition. Oh wait is it sorry it's not following me. Okay this institution see this this note uh is like um my name ID. So basically everyone has ID in the institution uh because they're just a case number the date of birth my date of birth uh the meeting date um uh 2017 and this is my discharge in 2017 so uh I came there I was admitted uh 2015 16 17 I came there two years after I thought was like a year it's actually two years uh this is an institution I was in partner in care this one in North um but again I lie to say so this why is very there uh Uh uh there um here let me read some things. Uh this is when I came uh to media you center uh yes this is like uh where I got my bachelor degree. Oh no sorry not my bachelor degree my independent leave certificate. Uh my consent form blah blah blah uh Nami uh first name Nami surname Abala date of birth uh 1905 and age 16. I was 16 years old. So uh 2017 I was 16. Uh I came there 2015. I came out 2017. Uh no I came there 2015. Uh that's a year actually. Yes. Uh sis clam. Uh this my foster carers. Uh Mr. Jadi, Mr. William. Uh but this evidence this data guys. This is how you fight for human rights. You push your data and you sue them. Uh this is the partnersh uh the care. Uh they meant to get me out there even before I did this current medication. cuz I was taking medication uh the uh respirator 1 milligram arroposal uh 5 mig and uh and sodium vapor uh 400 mg uh guys take a picture of this he's doing uh for discharge family third of so basically they keep you for a year and they don't really care they meant to get you in a situation if you don't have a problem uh but the sign the council signed me there uh he was diagnosed with aspect syndrome in 2014 has a history of vulnerability his mother report him suffering from psychosis too. Uh mother has reported that in May 2005 he's reportedly hearing voices but mothers dismissed thinking he was uh joking until he reported his believing that spaceship were coming uh where adults children live uh and that he was uh also the real biological the blood of Jesus. uh mother has reported that he developed sexual initiation towards his um immediate family members taking the actual towards them. He uh believed his mother and his girlfriend uh was his girlfriend touching his mother and youngest sibling uh inappropriate saying that he enjoyed uh it as much as he does. Uh she was walking out of shower naked saying he was good-looking although unable to appreciate how inappropriate that behavior in front of his siblings. uh Nambdi was assessed uh by the uh uh EW uh uh MS in November 2005 2015 and was referred to uh uh the to early intervention in psychosis uh EIP uh see that see that uh that is so disgusting uh because there's no evidence to back this up and I'll never admit to being a crazy person or or doing something. So theism is broken. You see that they will lie lie lie to me lies. You know who said this? Where's the proof? You know they're going to lie. Uh let me continue. Uh Nambi continued to believe uh believe uh that he had some kind to source uh and they gave him powers that god give him a body. Uh but he said prior he was but was he a man. He was not human because he had a thing called the source. He could allow him to read people's mind, see through other experiences and create a world in his and talks to people. And he also said at some point in the past he lost part of the source as a bare uh historians. He stated he understand he was uh saying does not sound rational but he believes in a paranormal so it must be true. He has been observed to have sexual inherit behavior. See this is all lies. Lies you know. You know where's the proof? Let me show you one of proof. hospital, you know, uh he uh he had he had a physical examation, GP review, uh blood tests and ECGs, uh blood tests, uh um uh results were uh from 17th of uh uh September 2017 uh which showed um uh race prolactin of 835 his ECG 17 that's uh show sinus rhythm with complex with abrant in condition and interpret promotion complex and a T abnormal in the lateral lead um and in according to the Kut entry of Dr. Haj was this sorry oh it was this doctor Dr. Haj look his name guys someone find me that guy someone he put money in my bank account he knows what he did this what he did to me Dr. Haj Haj Haj uh of 17th of uh EG was reserved reviewed and uh Dr. Haj who did a examination who was the normal uh um Dr. Smith cuz that was an Asian psychiatric Dr. I'm here three people you know these people don't care you know and there his blood pressure was monitored regularly and they are in normal range I didn't want to be there I don't want you to do blood I do actually do this I want to get out of there this is all lies there's no one of proof that this is the the truth they even ask me what I wanted to do you know and I knew I was there for for for them to experiment on me harass me abuse me but I I knew my rights to come out there anyway because I do want to be There it's got a discharge. Say I say I want to leave. I found word discharge. The word discharge. Don't tell me the word discharge. I was I said I want to leave. I see it to say discharge. Discharge. Who told you you cuz I don't know the language to communicate with them. Uh I spoke to you. Uh I would need to uh basically this a supported house. This my care home. Uh this is just uh housing the the care services that make me homeless. AK supported housing. Uh basically um uh this just uh something called an incident report. Uh this like if something happened in the care home uh they write an incident report and they say a bit in solve the issue they they they they make it worse for me. Uh I spoke to you uh um I spoke to you that I would need to speak to staff to find out what happened to get her feedback. I spoke to stuff Mary on the 29th of April 2024 on her in she went during shift on the 27th of April 2024 at 10:50 she noticed you use the toilet and show to the kitchen to pick up biscuits from the container. She noticed oh that's my initials Nala was walking or taking it one after the other with bare hands. Staff asked if you washed his hands uh uh uh his hand after using the toilet. He said no. staff said uh you cannot be touching uh all the biscuit with your unwashed hands and told him to close it. Uh so basically this is a dispute incident when they when something happening in the care home they continue institution if you get worse. This is disgusting what you write but this is just what they do. So say they they have the story your story don't matter. So basically whatever they write their own I write my own too because there's two sides to every story. It's very important to remember there's two sides and uh very important to remember. So you try to twist they try to twist everything make it it your fault you know try to use some formal reasoning but you know you have to incriminate them but you know without knowing what they say. So how I do it? How I do it using construction or destruction before? I write my own. But I write in a way uh that uh that makes it keeps makes it ongoing you know. So it makes it worse cuz they they don't comply. So their story just nonsense you know. Uh for example um you have to find something to pick anyway cuz you know they can't be all right you know to say all this nonsense. It's not right uh to to do this. Nami made a cup of tea, took some biscuits and ate. He called his mother and remained in his bedroom. Later the office I stayed in my bedroom. Yes, you people harassing me. Uh to stick up pack was going to his mother's place on social leave. Staff supported him and he left the house in a good mood cuz I was masking. I was masking. I was masking. I was in a good mood. In response to your complaint uh staff uh uh I listen to staff in this situation. I would advise you in this type of setting uh precaution need to be taken away. So staff need to observe their own staff. When staff observe they owe you difficult care point so it's corruption can be made this to prevent any infection but there was no bit I say to them that you know this is infect matter you know I I I washed my hands in the office toilet then I came down to take the biscuits then I got to we again then I went to the toilet and I took some more biscuits cuz there was no food no water no nothing and this was the root about me they didn't care you know cuz I didn't have food you know I was I was eating chicken and chips chicken and chips I was only eating like breakfast chicken and chips and uh dinner chicken chips like I always do you know and you know when the chicken pass a week the bin chicken chips you know on the junk food because they say it's infection control infection control you know this of me uh getting food I have to buy a lot of chicken chips and a drink which I start keeping in my bedroom uh in this type of setting uh precautions um however I applaud you for raising the question to email all is emails emails emails she want to write more emails she applauded Uh this professor makes bully label. Uh your your wearable cont staff are treated respect and yelling is not acceptable. Yelling yelling why why I want to be in camera. If you fail this one bully well sorry you're not sorry you're not sorry you know this is simple thing. Uh they couldn't resolve it. Uh next one uh uh a guide um a guide to subject access don't know how to uh uh make a subject arrow. You can look at this, can get this token off yourself. If you go to the ICO, the information commission's office. Uh uh what else? What else? What else? What else? What else? What else? Basically, this this looks like a paper I used to gather all evidence. Uh but you see there's many empty pages here. Uh but they're not all empty. Uh cuz it's not a full uh I'm trying to find my bachelor degree here. Um uh one second, let me find my bachelor degree, guys. Um uh bachelor bachelor bachelor. Uh so basically this why the reform actually matters. I want a house. It's telling me I can't get a house. I go to B. Okay. Basically this is my personal personal learning. Here it says uh I'm be honest here. Uh provider Midk College and um oh sorry Midk even got it. So basically Ct limited NFC. This is my bachelor degree uh certificate reference number uh creative creative surgical encoding practice 31st of October 2024 last year. Uh end date 22nd of January 2025 grade not application uh status completed overall aqua achieved there's no grade for bach degree you get a you get use a computer you can use computer code next one this is it just take a good picture of this you know uh this why I disclose everything to them you know see it guys can you see it can you take a picture when someone like screen record this you know or pause it here just pause it one two three four five look again one three four five again one two three four five that's it so we get um mid college city and girls London functional skills I have a functional skills do you know oh yes I did yes basically I did a function skills already uh and then I did because you know I didn't have to do anymore at in English and then I did uh 11 September American gateway academy and I certificate in skills. I'm business. I'm a businessman. Business mission. Look, business admission. You know, guys, I told you guys I'm a businessman. And then this like uh this one's uh certificate. Uh oh, I was withdrawn. Basically, I was withdrawn for skills and the gateway, but I passed uh the the the the basically I did the business course, but I didn't complete this. But I do I do know what I'm doing now. Then I did national open college uh certificate certificate in uh skills employment and personal development uh PA uh that's pass uh mid Kent uh general basically general general awards um no awarding body uh other work experience uh PA uh and then non-regulated adult uh skills uh uh formula funded non division preparion for work uh 19 uh hours and this is completed uh skills training uh generic no award body uh uh withdrawn uh this was non-regulating adult uh skills formula funded provision uh no defined level preparation work but I really got this I already did like uh ESF learning start and assessment uh achieved diploma in IT user skills diploma diploma and I go see this my GC this my certificates you know you want to pay for them you see this GC You see see all the the one on the right you know this a lie about a can lie and I got more here you know this like a print of the personal learning records you know I've learned so much from them and they know nothing from me uh personal learning record what else uh basically two of these bad boys uh this just a back um English English uh grade two um AQA uh grade two uh South SS uh AQA grade three two uh but this was uh who was this um AQA education. Uh but I love AQA more than um uh unit assessment. Uh I didn't get any uh pass. Uh yes, using the internet. I passed all of this. This is uh Gateway Academy units the models. And then one more basically this is the models unit models unit models. See see I passed it. Uh only two of them. Basically two here. See I passed it. Uh see it pass it. Uh There we go. Um I will go this one last one last show. Instead of them giving me support, giving no house, they don't they want to have I send them and they don't want to give me you can't see me. Uh but this one difficult here. So we get u personal south uh college south college and further education of qualify 9 to1 completed uh completed this is like um uh 9 to assessment of qualification alliance uh btech national diploma but this information tech I was withdrawn for that uh and then we got uh because that's what m basically Mr. Rati Ramen withdrew me from this level two course and I went on online and done the bachelor anyway cuz level three uh affiliated and then South College generally I achieved this one uh jump award but PA pass work experience placements I don't work experience why am I working for no reason completed completed completed but no achievement cuz certificate to implement skills function skills and this is just function skills I really go function skills I said I don't need function skills function skills and and FC achieve grade or none and unit of FC my personal Americ stuff it's disgusting and these are just uh this is just this a UK failure this why we have a division uh this year and I want to use my advantage to buy the lotments. I will buy diamonds. I will buy it, you know. I I will buy it. I'll find my right to the program, the English devolution and the and the and if I don't do it now, I it be harder to do it because I have great opportunity in business to do it. You know what I'm saying to you guys? The opportunity is immense. Uh what's the time now? Uh uh 1 hour. Oh, it's been 17 minutes. It has been 30 minutes. Okay. Yeah. This has been productive time. Uh 15 bank statements now. Nationwide knock. Uh so this is my case number. Uh did I print the evidence? Yes, I did. I did print it here somewhere. I I don't know. I don't know. I do have basically uh I did print it here. Once again, guys, um you are not homeless. So this is what they said. So basically I got on paper here so I can I can record it. Uh so this is like uh 15 way where I'm currently residing. Uh here uh take a picture of that. Uh this just one. So basically uh Mr. Namala 15 is uh sent by email. Okay. The housing act 1996 as amended money for knowledge requested for assistance under the act be considered following careful extensive uh crisis based on uponation you given us to inform you an elible person you are not homeless uh the reason uh you you you put the council you approach the council on the 30th of the 12th the 30th of the 12th the 4th actually yeah no no it was the 29th of November 29th November I was homeless you know but this one this one say make uh look like it wasn't nothing seeking assistance obtaination in no cases when a person has approached the council seeking accommodation assistance in obtaining the counsel whether a person has reason to believe he or she may be home or threat home within the 56 the council has accepted this to be reason that you believe you may be homeless or threat homeless such as uh under the duty to carry out uh inquiries who wrote this letter uh uh adult social care and housing after condes who wrote uh uh oh the whole Uh I've reached that I have reached basically I've reached uh however I'm certified you're not homeless uh or homeless uh um because you have you have uh you have accommodation which you uh available uh to you uh available to you and other members of your household that currently reside uh on marriage uh reasonable expenses I've taken during the uh I uh accommodation uh that resided on my reasonable big stated have undertaken the following inquiries into your case during the ter on the 15th of May. You explain that she will move out of commercial healthcare services because your friend are living in their own accommodation. No, I said I want a house under the health care system. Uh 2014 you stated that you lived in support for a long time. You prefer to live independently. I asked you uh I asked you if you are if you been asked you said you said no but you mentioned there's no issue with your teny uh that's a lie I said that there's no issue by I said there's no issue because why don't my contract uh on the 16th of May I th your social worker advised me you are placed in a current accommodation by that service they are still responsible for your accommodation and you still receive ongoing support I don't want support I want a house uh on The 6th of May the according to KS Amina explained to you that you have not you have not asked for she explained that you requested a property leave the independent leave the property uh independent because your friend lived on her own because she stayed um that she stopped your taking medication because you were you believe they're not working without the medication. this one under the housing team uh trying to do medication. Having considered and certified your accommodation hiker services uh you're certified at accommodation uh hik services which is available to you. Uh this is because why they saying this is because uh he services uh bridge IGQ uh is because you provide the placement on social care on ongoing basis. I want a house. Uh she's probably see and this is a person one that I that I never know you know just making magician on my life on the life of me because they don't want to make anybody do any uh do any capacity only want money uh affordability uh who's writing this one second uh king Jo hospital I should put this uh affordability uh I don't have any money to pay for this look this is nonsense look at this affordability the time 20 minutes I to the moment affordability. I'm certified that the property is affordable and your placement has been paid there as you can pay 96 weekly and you rent 95 monthly who wants to pay 96 I don't want to pay house is free on social care uh risk of violence no risk of violence uh GP 30 minutes walking 30 minutes on the bus uh kofa I don't care I don't want to be in I want I want to be in Cambridge this can lie They love lying. So that's you see this is broken token. It doesn't apply to me. Uh even the even the uh even the housing act 196 that doesn't apply to me. Even though I worked there it could apply if I worked but I did work and it does apply you know but he's stating that it doesn't apply is a lie because I worked and I live in thug inspire hub you know all the things. Uh and then other things that happened uh 15 is way what else cost of living NHS uh portal this is my passport. you know what is just evidence to sue them you know cuz you know I I I'm suing them my section 203 takes you to court but anyway uh section 203 you know and that's why I picked that section 202 that's exactly reason why why I I I picked exact reason uh that's that's the only reason why why I picked it uh explicitly section 202 because it goes to 203 uh yep uh fine you can lie for any money no That's who man lie for any money. I'm not lying. Uh I can't find the battery exactly but I can't find other. Uh that must mean it's here. It should be here. If it's not here, I'll post a video anyway. Um let me try. Um uh this will evidence everything. Um so basically Ni uh if you don't want to erase member then I came here but I can't find anything else. So I'll put the video cuz getting kind of too long. uh because uh I can't upload to Tik Tok if it's over an hour. Okay guys, go to my GitHub pages. Go to my chain.org/obi nexus_reform. This video is very important to see how the health system actually works. They scream against me because I said my friend I said everyone in social care has a house and that is including my friend and if I don't leave here now I will never get an independent property on other social care system. I've never seen a difference in any way, shape or form. Thank you.
me. It's just one thing I have to make today. Okay, guys, guys, I will not become what soul to break me. I will build what kind of healer soul. You know, that's the policy on my system. That's the very important policy. That's the very important thing is that you need it. You don't want it. You need it. Any new implementation that goes through in the very important thing is just like feed or the shelter for housing. You need that, you know, stability, you know. There's no, human rights are getting better, but, you know, the law and order around it is getting better. So, basically, I got my poem here. It's not poem. It's my story. I got it here. Look, guys, look at this. I got to read this thoroughly. I got to understand it. You know, this, I'm okay holding up. You got to understand what it really means to me. I'm going to cry about it. I'm not going to cry about it, but it's going to be about my history in Nigeria and everything. I'm going to give you the metaphysical, what's it called? That's all the story you want. I'm going to read it. I'm going to read it. I'm going to give you the message. Now, this story is called Pandora's Box. Pandora's Box, a fan section by me, Namdi. Okay. Okay.
So, basically, I'm going to read this story. I'm going to give you the other one. But the goal of this is to have more oral seal. So, basically, this is an oral seal message. It's like, you know, we have a private key, not a public key. You know, like, you know, the public keys are the messages. You know, the messages, you know, can be like, the public keys can be like a bliss poem. But it's one message. This is an oral seal for me. But it's something called the reticle, like, you know, in the reticle. Like, you know, it's just rhetoric. It means that you say a lot, but it's just rhetoric. You know, it doesn't mean anything. It can mean something, but it doesn't have to be, because it's just based on the talk and what's going on at that time. You know, it can mislead you, because it's reticle. It's not really the truth. It can be somewhat true, but not true. You get it. But it's reasoning, about reasoning. My own reasoning, the rationale behind doing it, why are you doing that thing? You know, why are you trying to adjust the grand scheme of things at a small scale? You know, the minimal election alone. This is an oral seal message I'm going to give to you. That's, you know, it's just that way. I mean, how much does your lawsuit? My lawsuit is $360 million. I have to go to Cambridge to get it. But I have to go to Cambridge College, because the Roth Code said no to me. So basically, I'm building a legacy here, but I'm doing it the right way. I'm not like a rebellion in the wrong way. You know, I want to do my PhD in the UK, but I don't think I can do it no more. And I don't want to go through the bureaucracy. But this story is really important to me. It really means something to me. Okay, okay, guys, let's just begin, because AutoAI, oh, wait, oh, AutoAI is never recording. Anyway, let's just begin, because this system is kind of not recording, not recording. Okay, it's not recording. It must have stopped. Anyway, anyway, it's not recording AutoAI. And that's the problem. Anyway, I've got my audio book. Okay, no, no, no. Okay. Today is the Pandora's box. Today, I will not become what is supposed to break me. I will heal, or heal us, or build or heal us. And that's part of all the policy systems. If I'm ending as an invariant, I go through the policy, I must heal itself. You need to follow through with no education. But I'm not supporting a lot of these things. Okay, this Pandora's box, my take, my fanfiction. Okay.
The lady, Pandora, today, okay, today, okay, the lady stared just at the box, never, I was told, never to open it. The box was these, the weapon, the evil. She looked at, she looked at it. She was, because the matter is ready, it's already just right now. That's what I'm really important. She looked at it, she has a gaze that her wonder about it, pondered about it. And why her husband never told her to open the box. She was curious, Pandora. She wanted to open the box, but she never did. Because of her husband, you know, the box was open, was never to open. It was sealed with locks and chains. And I'm meeting because I'm making it up because I'm going with the flow. Pandora was to keep it in secret, to hide it from the public view, and to never show it or tell about it. She was powerful, she was as powerful as the man, as the husband, but she was a woman. She had a womb, she had to protect and serve in other ways, but her husband instructed Pandora to guard the box. One day 25 years later, Pandora is 25, by the way, her husband's friend came and asked Pandora, your husband, have you seen him? Have you heard of him? Have you heard the news? She answered, no, no, I've never seen him. My husband came one week, in one week, and talking to me one week ago, one week before, he gave me this after fact, he calls the box, and never opened it, because she's 25, she's 15 now, and she never opened it. She answered to him, oh yes, the box, yes, yes, why the box? He said, she's kind of curious, she never knew about it, you know, and the woman, yes, yes, I know about that box too, and the man replied, yes. But he said, I should never, I'm not going to talk about it, I don't know nothing about any box, Pandora replied, she lied. Then the husband says, don't worry, I got evidence for you. The husband's friend asked him, asked her, to give away, that she's going to give him all the keys to the box, to open it. Pandora, what? You have keys to the box? You know what this box contains? Yes, but the husband replied, I have bad news too. Your husband, the Pandora's box says, yes, you're my husband, what? It's deceased, he died in the war. What war? I'm not sure of a war. Oh Pandora, I'm sorry to tell you, but your husband's deceased in the war, in the war, the war happened one week before. What? Yes, didn't you hear it in the news? Yes, the war happened one week before, they had to go to the war. The butterflies in the battlefield had to cease your husband, he's deceased now. But that was 25 years ago, he died on the front lines. So Pandora asked why he died on the front lines, what happened? Oh, the husband replied, it was a tragedy, he got caught in the midst of the madness and the chaos and the fire. But that box was his seal, was his aura, but he didn't abide by what was there, set in stone, or do his job. He was part of the royal monarchs, as you know, he was part of the king's leadership. He was the one with the keys to unlock the box. And what Pandora replied? He panicked. So what's on the box? The husband gave her the keys, the husband's friend, sorry, gave her the keys. And then gave Pandora at the time the relief to do it in peace in her own time. The friend replied, your husband's aura has not been sealed. What does that mean? Pandora asked. You are part of the monarchs, part of the most powerful family, that means the kings. We have military control. How could this have happened? Pandora asked. Pandora panicked and screamed. And grabbed the keys on the structure man to open the box containing Ashita Katan. And his friends said, yes, here are the artefacts to unlock this box. It was sealed for a reason. You need the time. You need to radically reason, rational, about this. You need to take your time to look at the seal, to see why your husband's seal was not sealed, and why his Christian's master said no. She thought just one week before, she heard news about the war, and she read the stories about the war with the newspaper article in the box. She opened it, and she saw that. And then one week before there was a war, before the war was announced, the next week there was a war, the visual war. She told nothing of it. But then she opened the box to find her husband was a military leader in the war, in the colonial power system. And she was his wife. Now she's his spouse. 50 years later, she was 15 years old. It's kind of interesting. But she seems all her husband's power did nothing to protect her and her legacy, or the royalist petition of the people or the corruption in Nigeria. In the making, the legend of the making, she threw the keys, and with the camera, it's 25 years, November 2014 to 2011, 25. With the camera, she opened the box to see what her husband had sealed. Guys, the box is sealed, because that's the only thing he did. And he went to do the job of the human rupture. 25 years later, opened the keys, took the box, and evil. And she saw the news, the weapons, the nuclear codes that was meant to be instructed and guided and used according to the principle of the protocol and the mortals, the missiles, and the secret talks that was meant to be accomplished. But her brother was ignorant. He didn't do this. After confusion, after confusion, her husband started to cry and would tears. But why? She knows enough. She was confused about her husband and why he didn't act. But he did act, she thought. She was confused. She was paranoid. But he went, but he never came back. And next to confusion, she looked herself in the mirror, when she got her box from her house. And she was concerned, shocked, and she began to cry, tears. She's going to look herself in the mirror, a reflection of her soul, her spirit, or her soul, you know, as a child, you know, who she was. She cried. She stared at herself. She became what? Broke them. The change started with them, but now I transcend that change with us. That's me. Guys, that's what an oral seal means. You know, that's just an example. These guys have put that, these two oral seals like this, so basically, as a child, I go through the broken system, blah, blah, to reflection of myself, of what is yet to be and become. I became, as an adult, an adult of journey back to becoming a king, because what am I trying not to do with others? I'm an adult, 25. I'm going with Nigeria. I don't have a house in the UK. I don't really care. But I'm a British Nigerian passport. As an adult, I go back to the broken system to, yo, fix that thing. And that's all the broken infrastructure there. You know, this is Pandora's box by me. And I'm the brother. The change started with them, but I transcend that change with us. I will not be, also, to break me. I will build, work in your soul. And that is the world's first life, work, constitution, live, work, breath constitution. You know, you live there, you work there, you breathe there. You know, there's no, there's no structure. The infrastructure is broken, and it's against you by design. By design, not by, not even by the token, not only by direct construction, but how it's built is fragmented. It's fragmented. For me, this is, like, how I want to do it.
Because I see problems in Italy. You know, I see patterns in the city. There can be problems, you know. I can reach my way through the system, but you guys can't. You know, you just have a battery in the green cup. You don't have to mess up. This is my will. I'm going to move again. This is my lawsuit. This is what it means. You know, it wasn't my wife, you know. And this happened to me. I would tell my wife, like, you know, if that's the one I care about, I don't have a wife or a friend or girlfriend, you know. I would tell her, look, this box is very open. But don't keep it in secret. You know, if I die or something happens, you must take charge. I really see the problem. Because, you know, so you can have this seal. You know, everyone can solve this problem of this missile crisis, you know. Because, you know, the different war is terrible. Because, you know, remember, well, it's not a drug.
It was terrible. It was 50 years. In fact, it took me to the last three years. But there's not a decreshing date. So the date between us, you know, there's been five years. Now it's 50 years. Now the situation has passed. The situation has passed. I am now holding a torch. I'm not a torch bearer, you know. Don't worry about Nami Kano. Nami Kano doesn't understand what I'm doing. I'm doing something else. I'm doing stuff. I'm actually building stuff. You know, he's like doing stuff. He's like my one. I'm a rebel. But I'm not in the rebel in that sense of the word. I'm a rebel. But I'm in the right way. You know, I'm repairing the way that cannot be broken down easily. You know, that's what I'm saying. I'm telling you, this is the birth 19th of May, 2001. 1905, you know, Generation Z, Gen Z. You know, go Gen Alpha. You know, those people in Nigeria, they're fucking up the whole time. They're messing things up. This is Pandora's backs. Pandora cried. She rubbed and shuddered. And the tears bled until she passed out. You know, she became a maniac in the end.
You know, she became a mechanic. Because, you know, the infantry did not sustain her. And she just got older and died. Why? Because no one 25, 50 years old is too old for Nami Kano. You know. You know, I mean, people like young women, you know.
But, you know. In Nigeria, you can get 50 million times in a different manner. But you have to have stability. You know.
She's not stable. You know.
She can be powerful, yes. But she doesn't have that alignment. Because the government around her has changed. Everything has changed. You know.
She can't get anyone. You know.
If she wants to marry or have a child. It's not that bad. That has to. That has to mean the story. That's it. For the magical implication. That's what it means to have an aura seal. You know. Their aura was a change. Their change was us, was them. You know, them. But them was not us. You know.
We are different from them. That's what it's them. Us.
We can be them. But you know.
Them doesn't mean us. Because you know. I want something. We are against each other. And this is the real world. You know. We are fighting against systematically. By design. By how fragmented the ecosystem is. How you can buy carbon. Buy food. I can't find water. You know. That's kind of thing. I want to heal as well. You know.
I want this as a policy. In that thing. And everything invariant wants to be. I'm going to put that there. Sorry, no sir. Everything is inferior. I want to cover the foundation. You know. You know. My constitution. Don't worry about the summit. At least by killing people. I don't want to kill people. I want to build people. You know. If I can. It's not about empathy for me. I'm not.
I'm a competition. I'm a scientist. I'm a scientist. It's about end result. And that's what I'm saying about. You know. I don't have to fail you. You know. I know. I'm autistic. As per just. This is what this law system means to me. My greatest capacity. My healing begins. My journey. My time is now. My healing begins. You know. I'm not talking to you guys. You know.
I'm talking to myself. This is for a moment for myself. You know.
I'm not being. I don't care. I don't care. I don't have values. I don't know who's the beast. Who wants me to be. You know. I have a room. You want to see my room? No. Come on. I'm here for you. Anyway.
Look. I'm part of a mentor. I have ADHD. As per just autism and disability. And this autism stuff. Talking about the modern body. And we shouldn't have. What is it. What's stop. They can't do anything. They must stop. I'm seeing those people. I can see you. I'm not seeing people that don't do that to me. You know. And I'm going to leave this UK. And when I come to Nigeria. I'm going to fix this. My aura. My aura. I have to seal my aura. I have to build what. What can heal us up. And I will do that. I'm going to trust you that change, that's what you're doing to enjoy the killing of all the evil people, black people, and this like what I do, because I'm a king there, I'm king of the navy, I'm a member of the states, I'm a member of the, you know, I'm going to build, I'm going to heal, heal, sustain us of the Bfrens, you know, the Bfren, uh, uh, uh, Iwu, uh, Iwu constitution, uh, uh, uh, means, uh, public, uh, Iwu, IWU means low, and uh, Oda means, uh, an IJE, that's IWU OHA, uh, public, uh, UWU, um, low, uh, IJE Lola, separation of concern, uh, principles, repositories at github.com, slash OBNACAS, thank you.
