Unknown Speaker  0:14  
National Movement. It's kind of weird.

Unknown Speaker  0:28  
Okay, we're going back to

Speaker 1  0:30  
my channel, guys, I want to just, like, talk to you guys about my systems. Okay, we're gonna start with onions. No, this is onion system. No, no, no. Okay, let's start with the onion system. But it is about now. Muka is my brand name for my gaming industry. PSN, polyglot. Polyglot just means many languages

Unknown Speaker  0:56  
or any system. Polyglottic, any system.

Speaker 1  1:00  
So the term polyglot means poly means many. Glut means language, so many languages, many are dialect. And the term polygraphic, major things in our business means in any language system. In our system, it's about systems, like computer systems. Okay. Now introduction to Muco. Muco is a beautiful two words. I can't remember the words, the moon is low, tone under it

Unknown Speaker  1:30  
goes down. MMU,

Speaker 1  1:39  
so that's the MOOC, oh, Muco stands for the spirit of good and evil that connect. So basically, the call is connections. You know, it's made of two as Muco connects hot soul connections. Obi was hot. Muco is same thing, but it's for gaming as a spirit of good and evil that connects us all. That's what Muco means. That's a motor. And, you know, they can add your own tagline industry, create your own tagline. Here, for me, it will be like combo TV, Mr. Combo, you know, get you know something about the and I did just that. And I built my own systems, now, Muco is a digital avatar. System is built around the humans. It's built around the people, the gamers

Unknown Speaker  2:27  
people. It's

Unknown Speaker  2:29  
really a gaming suite

Unknown Speaker  2:32  
together, mooco,

Speaker 1  2:34  
mooco engine, dash engine, or Muco dot Connect. Let's start with the thing, okay, Muco dash Connect. Spirit of So, okay, so you get the Muco dash Connect system, which is like the Muco socials, or Muco dash Connect. That's like the system, the parallel system for connection on the for gamers only. But the goal is like you build it around the fandom. Fandom is the people who express themselves with their own culture. The fandom the group of who you're actually selling to, the gamers, you know, the people based on the avatar as a protocol, you know, I'm tailoring this, this kind of unique avatar, to someone who played red demo Russian understands this line of war in especially this line, and I'm just thinking about the people I'm feeling this kind of where, you know, it's about merchant that, you know, the goal of this thing is to have the fandom, which is the fans that follow you, actually continue to follow you, and can grow your fan base. You know, you can build your own feature, but let's start there. So you have to govern yourself too, because, you know, Muco is a platform. It's a gaming platform, you know, PS five right now, and Xbox and internet switch. So I can put out the Muco services so you get Muco connect, social media connect, Muco Ng, which is a local gaming engine, the Muco engines, not just nuclear engine. It's not one engine, it's Muco engines. So the engines is like the gaming engines, the all the engines that allow you to for new development, first, of course, as a policy, and all the sources of the policy, the goal of the fandom is to ensure that people are getting the service they need. You know, telling the people keep coming back to gaming. You know, especially never leave gaming. They don't need to know when you play a game. You know, you don't want to be, you know, well, have fun. You know, even for one, even for like, a 30 minutes. You know, you log in, shining sign it for 30 minutes. You know, the thing about the gaming, game is fragmented, too. So when I try to put a gaming I have to spend 30 minutes setting up, and then I have to pick together for five minutes, 15 minutes to play the game. And that's just the time, you know, 15 minutes, and then the timer runs up. But one match is 30 minutes, so 30 minutes set up. It's like boring. So that's one, you know, I just put I just come in, I want to play the game. Open my console. I just play the game. I defragment everything. You know,

Unknown Speaker  5:07  
you know. Muco, turn on.

Unknown Speaker  5:10  
You know, you know.

Unknown Speaker  5:12  
So the goal of this

Speaker 1  5:14  
is to have a onion system now, but Muco Connect is a social media platform. Muco or connect the social media question, Instagram, Snapchat, all your social media platforms. How you should? It doesn't have to be PSN, you know, you can any system. They can Muco, gaming engines, the engines that around the gaming you know, this can be gaming engine social which is Google Games and engine for social media. But you know, for new social media, now you got the mucosandom. Now, equity is a key principle. Now equity is like the principle, the first principle of equity is before equality, even the fair share of disability, especially neurodivergent ones. The fandom is really based on the game design, the blueprint, you know, polyglot architecture at somatic value and x and all of that system come together to give you a Muco sweet now, so you go with more suites like, you know, you can, if you basically switch S, U, I, T, E, you know, you can use the Muco engine without using the Muco connect services, you know, because you can build on top of the service. You know, I don't want people to do so basically, you guys gonna have, you're gonna have to create a fandom, a fandom, join a fandom, and then gonna start becoming part of that fandom, get into it, and then you're gonna move on. But I'll come to that now. So the goal of this is to ensure the polygonal systems is human centric, you know, gamer centric, you know, you know, let's call it our central you know, human center, human avatar centric. You know, I'm expressing what I want to express. You know, I'm being me in this game. You know, this is me, you know, this is Nnamdi. This is Leah. You know, the authenticity of the Avatar, you know, is the person reflection in that game. You know, you know, there's no just good and evil. I love that. You know, concept for everyone to have, everyone must use that. You know. You know you like something you keep something No. Use it. To respect your license. Open Access prices versus even go to Open Access Licenses, which I've got open here you go, get that the use it. If you use the service, you respect the service. You know you become you have to respect it. You know, that's license. There you go, to engine. I'm thinking of a neurodivergent first license, which is what I'm saying, if I use this, I respect it doesn't matter what it is. It's just an open source license I made under like, it's not GPL, but I think GP is good for gaming about that. So the thing about this is just to ensure that the system is a system is faster. But, you know, I'm thinking of the best kind of people that can play the game. I'm thinking of the best kind of gamers, but with no money, you know, no money like me to buy a console. Basically, I bought a console. My mom bought three, but I never was easy enough, you know, but it broke down everything, a lot of issues, you know, the thing about the console was I was very good player, but I couldn't get the money to buy the money to buy the controllers, everything to use it efficiently. Like, for example, I had to, had to get, when I got a place like my brother wanted to use it, and I want to use it too, and we have to do different things. And my brother cannot use it my home dominated me to say, Oh, my problem, the problem, you know, those kind of problems. Has to solve that problem, you know, I think the problem with the information is the console is like my property to share it. You know, without my birthday,

Unknown Speaker  8:25  
foster care, where was I in?

Speaker 1  8:27  
Foster Care? In in, somewhere in, something called the contact, is like a social contact with my mom and dad, foster care. But the goal the professional gaming industry grows. You know, grows, grows, grows. You have to ensure opportunity. So basically, go like a fandom, or drugs or fandom blocks, blocks, you know, Avatar, you know, you know, I go rivalrous. Of course, you got people that don't believe anything. But This is to ensure that everyone should

Unknown Speaker  8:57  
do with equity, social, you know, it's not

Unknown Speaker  9:01  
even like just anyone. Have to keep my identity and

Speaker 1  9:06  
learning from each other at a bare minimum. If you open a fandom, you keep you get something from it. You know, for opening a fan and then trying to grow your fan fiction, for example, if you didn't like basically, can basically, if someone wants to build on an ecosystem, they do not have to do not like a hacker, they can get a royalty. Is like a system where they get royalties and they can use the system properly the way it is, like, you know, so basically, basically, if I'm paying, give my friend the royalty act like, you know, I can bear my realtors, but don't bring my realtors, you know. So basically, what's the royalty here? Basically, I get a fan function. So all of this is no narrative. So we got a story beginning in a, let's say Chicken, Chicken seven, which I loved. Now I can if I actually. They're not checking. But I want to make one fan fiction for tech, you know, I don't have to build the software to use it. I get a royalty to, you know, I get to know, you know, I register, you know, I get, I get part of that sometimes, you know, I am equitable. I use the call I get part of checking community apart. The system of taking a part of fiction off the road allows me to develop my own ending or story to that ending, and then people can then buy that ending or that, you know, but you know, that's one that's really good, you know, to have, like, you know, a diverse or stories, you know, alignment. You know, it's like motor combat, the table thing, motor combat hierarchy, King of the Hill. But you know, every, every every character ending, has a unique, unique one input. So the country ended for your story is based on how well you have, how well you have, like a How have you been following procedure, not to talk about complying, but complying in a legal way. You know, you know, trying to do yourself. You know, DIY policy. So basically, you can start, basically the busy when you get a hustle, you have a foundation. Basically all the stories you see are stories. But, you know, the whole goal humuko is to connect people in a spiritual level and express that connect the spirits that connects. That's the spirit of good at you that connects. So basically, anyone that has, like a bicycle doesn't matter, you know, as long as they can prove that this is something going on because gaming is basically and there's one more thing I want to enforce. So the thing about my myself, you know, I want to be active on my session, but exercise is very good for me. But, you know, pressing buttons all the time. So I'm not saying that she's bad to not play. But, you know, there's some guidelines and play for children, you know. But them saying is that the stimulus in the gaming for your finger is not really equitable to your body emotion. It's gonna be utopia. So for me, I'm thinking about dystopian without being honest. But I'm saying to you, you gotta understand stimulus. Basically, if I try to punch something, I should see it before I actually put it. Now, this is how fast him after, some kind of way to spiritually connect without him. You know, this is like a timing or something, see, like a combo timing, you know, after, after timing, sequence or like or like beauty in my my hearing, you know. But those things can be for me, you don't need fatigued, you know, playing games all day. So I'm fatigue just means side lazy, just bored, you know, just staring at the screen like in a zombie. So the dinner about this, you have to, like, understand that, you

Unknown Speaker  12:37  
know you're using go respect again.

Speaker 1  12:40  
So when you use the console, go to spread. The concept is so powerful, too. So, you know, over the consulate, you know, we will play gaming. The Muco platform represents, to me, like a way to interact with your authentic self, your inner self. You know, come home, you beat someone from work. You know that that didn't in the game vision. You know, games a month to gain some money to pay for your pay for rent, you know, pay for something else in the Premier, food, water, shelter, the bare minimum. That's what the relationship is really mean. Because, you know, if someone is choking trash and you beat them, and you get your money, you know that, you know the competition is like easy to do. So, you know that's saying this must be sure that there's equity. You know, if someone's trash, let them, or me, for example, let them go back to their books, go back to wherever they do, and update their own documentation. You know, whatever it is, you know, games can start tension early as possible, as three, three years to start playing. If you're three years old, you just need permission guidance. You just play FIFA. You know, there's no, there's no if about it. You know, it's not if about the thing about this equity to ensure a system people understand the real world as it is no but the nuclear suit is there. It's polygraphic. Polygraphic any system, any system that was a DLL, Windows or Linux shared object, or Macintosh

Unknown Speaker  14:02  
Dilip dynamics libraries or,

Speaker 1  14:06  
you know, okay, so the thing about this is ensure the avatar system is coherent to represent that state of mind, internal state of the person with another conversation as a functional thing. So basically, her position is functional. So there's a dilemma. It has really nice, no, it has no purpose. You know, that's obviously sure that anything nice has at least 75% functionality in it. You cannot look like, no reason.

Unknown Speaker  14:33  
5% functional, just like

Unknown Speaker  14:36  
a feature, you know, or like, let's just say, 60% function.

Unknown Speaker  14:42  
I wanted to be. Let's make it 52%

Unknown Speaker  14:47  
functional maximum you know, like

Unknown Speaker  14:51  
you know. Okay, let's say 45 let's say

Unknown Speaker  14:56  
45% functional to a.

Speaker 1  15:00  
Or 60% functional. You know, that's good for design experts and get something useless. But the things about this ensure that the fandom is coming, so that you can mark the games, but not much the games, but, you know, expand on the story. You know, you know what they and how beautiful story, the frame for the story. But you know, that's fandom is. It's a community of people that come together that believe one thing. For me, I go other fans. I'm a fan of ecology fandom. But you know, the social arguments go online. You know, you can't just open up documentation on the side, but really, you're doing it in training mode. If you're a power coach, you can't learn about so basically, encouraging goods have to go online a lot to solve a problem. But you know, to train on the AI and Botswana has no internet, all that shit. Or stop now switching the fact, you know, if you learn again, learn the game, win the console in a console you know, in the street, you know, and it should be to play the game while learning the game. You know. You know, and learn your way. You know it's not my way. You learn your way. I want to learn my way again. You know, every time I have notes, I just keep typing and stop. But the fandom is a community of the students you go, like Muco console. Muco studio, basically got cross platform, cross platform alignment. But, you know, I feel the video come for PS five and Xbox. But you know, retro game, retro games are very good. You know, 10 years. You know, 10 years to play a game. You know, you go back to it. You can go back to 10 years because, you know, doesn't really matter, you know, that's what we preserve. The system was allowed to play the game because your game, you bought it, you know, if you just use it, you use it. You respect the game, you know. But the games are the game engines store that you know, you know. Just, just roll back or anything. Just, you just have to get the enemy system evolve to handle new old games, you know, because it's like, handle new old games. So the thing about this is the fandom represents, to me, authentic connections in the game. You know, you know, what do you do? What do you like? Something you don't like, something you want to be scared of, something we want to kill people the game doesn't matter to me. But, you know, we get killed on the server. Just make sure that you know that they have a good room for doing that. You know, you know, waking up in a really player walk too, because, you know, I play one, I'm simply two, but play twos, play one. So goal shall have like the person, the person that's the first person, give the other player, player two. There's no chance, you know to play the game, you know to see what

Unknown Speaker  17:23  
they like it. Angela would go to

Unknown Speaker  17:26  
different final weeks to do that thing. Obviously active sensor.

Speaker 1  17:29  
It doesn't just globally control other services. For me, represents like, the foundation of like, accessing the right service. So this is basically open access this. I can onion router, like you can talk to the system, but this is some onion system. It gives you information when you need it. Basically it's bioinformatic, but it's like, does he allow me to do it? That's what onion services. So basically buy dot products. Basically, think about this onion. It's like, it's a router. So it's gonna directly evolution engine, go see language service and polygon. So basically, the only router is just allows

Unknown Speaker  18:14  
the right, am I right?

Speaker 1  18:18  
Basically, it's just like a bitch. It's been destroyed. It's like a torrenting for neighboring because, you know, it allows you to route the right service by your age. So if you're three to four, you are your document on your route. You know, you can't. You can't go past a game that's three, three to four. If you're four years old and you're three years old and it's piggy three, you cannot buy a game that's six or five. You know anything plus, because you know your age. It doesn't need a user ID, because you just back from it. You don't need to have your age. No, you're not ready for this game. And system knows, go talk to your mom. So basically, by law, you need someone at least seven years old. But you know, if your brother seven years old, they can log in with the onion system, and then they can think, if you're three years old, you can play the game, you know, because that's the idea. So basically, still, someone has seven, that's one person at seven ever leaves the group, the game pauses, because I don't want you guys breaking the system. So basically, the game there seven years old has to be with you, within our ID for you to play the game for seven, seven, so seven to eight, seven or 812, to 1312, or 13, sorry, and then you grow 15 to 16, and then 1616, season, 17 or 17, and then 17 to 18, which maturing 17 plus 18 classes, Like the adult stuff other games, but you know the transaction is to get the right service, you know, to ensure that people have the right system. But the onion router is like this, information processing biological based on my on your system. Basically, it's like onion skins, you know, basically the sweetest part of an ON. And it's like a bitter spot, you know, the hottest, basically, we saw with an onion, lay up the onion is like the surface of this onions. Even if I take the surface up, I get to something more on you it's like a smelly mostly, when I saw, you know, is it an onion that's stuck with the energy of onion routers? But, you know, you can, can get you that this is my ring topology on your phone, my ring zone topology. So basically, the more layers you peel off an onion, the more you, the less you, the more you're exposed to, you know, it's like you have, like, the more sensors, more things you're supposed to, you know, the more you cut. You know, that's saying, and that's why it's it's like a router we route, not with speed, but for Korean, every month is the first to arrive whole in both form, and so are you getting the right information? Is it for your bio? That's what the saw means. So the only router is a system here, but it's very important to use the system accordingly, because, you know, it's not very you know, it's not trying to get the game. There's no way to get game to start again, you know. So it doesn't matter. Basically, if you go a 12 year old there, and they have done in your game, and there's a three year old, is fine, doesn't really matter. But you have to be based on Peggy system. So if Peggy changes today, I'll change it myself, you know, because, you know, after Peggy, this onion two, and then this session five. So this is what is called a Muco connect, nuclear connect, the spirit. And I did just that. So this is my anchor, this Manka. So the Muco social media is like, I can play video games, but I can cancel everything. It's like a it's like the system is

Unknown Speaker  21:40  
coherent, because the nuclear console knows,

Unknown Speaker  21:44  
but there's a Muco thing. So basically,

Speaker 1  21:48  
right, read, write, execute, but this is like a photo on social media. So basically, anything you put on social media for continuous, like, you know, I want to go to, this is social media platform, yes, but it scared towards gamers, because it's more of a gaming interaction, you know, and Latino high, it's about to be harmonic and be together, you know, whether they are disconnected, you know, from very fast places. You know, it's about showing that the people are like a grounded truth, operational truth, community.

Unknown Speaker  22:21  
Improve these calls and vision.

Unknown Speaker  22:29  
But the thing about you is like a flatness,

Speaker 1  22:35  
like social media, but it's on steroids. It isn't gonna which allows you to express yourself authentically. You want to express yourself in a social interaction. Basically, I commit this was, like the one you're meant to be bumped, but you know this, like, ensure that you're authentically express yourself so you get level one, which is like from foundational, foundation. It's just true. I'm just talking about truth here. Level two is opportunity in the game social interaction. How to track with you, whether you rival or not, level four. So level three is community, okpa do and then level two is operational, and level one is Foundation. And then you get level four development, you know, technical, Malaga. Basically. The goal of this is actually half people technically will play the game, people that want to play the game and try the game and get better in the game, you know, I must be become competitive gamers. You know, gaming stupid, you know, I love gaming, you know, you know. But the gaming infrastructure is broke as fuck. Okay, so level six is philosophy, the philosophy the customer. Why alarm? Why that? Things are the things, why we heat up under the seven is the vision, the highest clinical the vision of doing a new combo. You know, what you want to achieve in the game. So level six is the philosophy, like, why I'm thinking this way, why I'm navigating this way? One doing this way, but it's all under the community. So basically, you got accommodation, and you go the philosophy behind it, PhD, philosophy, vision. You know, the best games in the world have visions for the games to be better. So I level seven. You meant to be really building five pictures, you know. But, you know, tick, tock, schema, research, one thread. But this, I'm saying moot code is like a system. Now, if you go to phantom high D, which I can't, I can show you here actually, but phantom ID is the same thing, but I haven't really got it here for you guys. What is phantom ID? But you find them with ID function call system. But phantom ID is a legacy one. This is just a phantom ID. It's basically your algorithm network, because, you know, you don't really know your but, you know, this is, like the Phantom ideal. This like the system knows you're there. But, you know, it's basically like a voice. Basically, if I'm if I'm talking myself, the Phantom node just touch me, basically, if I want to speak like and Frank, or something like a telecom.

Unknown Speaker  25:01  
It doesn't know you're there, basically

Speaker 1  25:05  
no someone's speaking, but it doesn't know who's speaking. It's just Batman speaking or the flash speaking. And that's telecom system that allows you to put in a persona, you know, that's authentic, you know, allows you to basically, this is how this works, is basically, it creates a it's literally just like, basically it's a authentic. So what phantom ID is you start a network, you start something called a process, and then you can run, you basically can run this code. Here you create a process. Here you start a process, and then you, when that person is created,

Unknown Speaker  25:43  
you, then you, then

Unknown Speaker  25:46  
you, then, like, how does it work? You

Speaker 1  25:51  
give that process an ID, and that person has an ID, but that person has an ID, and that has to be ID bound, but basically the ID is like the curriculum. So once one connects, they then send you a message. But, you know, you basically, you send a message terminal but, but the system is Phantom. It doesn't, it's like a phantom ID. You basically have some kind of phantom ID. And you don't, you know your ID, but you know, once the session is created, everything is run at one time bound. And then basically the comparison only, the only, the only the system is basically when the thing is compiled, you're in one time mode, and the system is running and then, but, you know, you can create more sessions of it, but it's like a higher position. This is a very dangerous project to use for now, but, you know, so basically, I can create an account, I can create a session. I can create a session. Another show will have a runtime, you know. But when the session will ban the background, and when I want to add new people, like 20 people service, and then that service closed off to the public, so you cannot in trouble. That service isolated. There's no there's no there's no get is there, the project ID is there, but it's not bound to it's bound to the system, not the program that's been called. So basically detached, but that's the symptom. Everything just removes. You know, you can't interact with that mode. So basically, when people are playing online, the Phantom, Phantom network is you can't even intercept it. But you know, the system a shot is only gets bigger hierarchy. So that's saying to you is you can use this for them, but you know you have to even create an ID, like a user account. Everything's an account in the system. The idea is sure that the Phantom network is coming because the Phantom ID account.

Unknown Speaker  27:48  
So basically, the thing about

Speaker 1  27:50  
phantom ID is that github.com, test phantom ID is the system understands the state, but, you know, it doesn't, it hasn't, so that the people that people that basically want to basically create a root node and root account, and then you create sub accounts around that root node in a Fortran way, and then the healing way, and then you destroy the root process. Because, you know, you have two nodes that are node A and node B, there are people that join that and switch their notes. You know, switch that note. Those are phantom ideas. But, you know, there's something very important about phantom ID in Italy, guys. So what FUD allows you to do is try to give you some code jobs, ID. It's like, so you have a job. Everything has a job. So basically, growth for you here. So you have like a, basically see, like this one, so you have like a two nodes, or cross these two represents like a job. The circle does what one job, one talks one thing, and the other one just like which a hybrid model. So basically they can switch the job they're doing. You know, I can be an admin in the moderator, but you know what he does? So basically, you create a new session. The session starts again. Then you pick what of your session is, we are moderator, and then you put a topology or something like that for it, and you can switch the road as fast everything. If I want to play the game, it's my sense of play. Basically, it's self orchestration. You can automate it, really, but, you know, you can use description depending on who comes in or not. But the thing is, like more, coherence. You know, it's a new hybrid system. So basically, the thing about photons topology, like a star cross star crossed, some kind of way to do the job. Because, you know this, like one example of a system that's photons, but you know the say, like you have two players, the circles are players, and they get the 1x looks like a moderator. Now, the person can have an X comes a moderator Consortium, or this one has to take a chance of being a moderator, of taking the game, of watching again, you know, watching what they're playing. Three person doing it. You know, another, cheapest model, you can do it. Can, you know, can switch between the. Players who took terms and they can win lose. Isn't about the system. It's very decentralized. You know, there's no there's no one that's there's no one else or the royalties you know, who the hierarchy can stop everything you know. But this was hierarchy bound function my Discord, you can question, if you're Hoffman, right back elimination tree, you know, because the red black elimination algorithm, which I invited basically the red black means it was something that's red king, that's not being used. It's get removed, and it gets affected. You don't need it, you know, it gets garbage collected. So the red is like a things that again, redder, redder. And then if someone is too red, you know, they get kicked off, you know, removed. And then the black, black berries, like me keep the kitchen going because, you know, they everyone has played authentically being, uh, being, uh, no business, you know. So basically, the Rebecca elimination on vision or shelf balancing trees, and this is the most remained as a spree, is, um.
