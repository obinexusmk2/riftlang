Speaker 1
Okay, today, Today is the 28th of January, 2026. So it is the 28th of January, 2026, yes. I have my section of papers, this is the prior admission to hospital. But literally, I'm going to read the last year's date. In your case, the 28th day ends on, ends on, it's on. So basically, this is the 29th of January, 28th of January, 27th. This is the 28th of January, 27th. if I leave, you know, because they are not abusing my rights to housing and everything, but, you know, it's not really in their power to detain me anymore, you know, because I've not, I've complied with the 8-day metric. So, this is my story. So, it's basically, how long would I be here? You're kept for up to 8 days, up to 2. During this time, you must not leave unless your, let's tell you, you may leave. uh yeah this is my therapist uh but you know if you try to leave the store can't stop you yeah i still can't stop you the stuff with water it's not the stuff and if you do if you do leave you can't If you were already kept in hospital under section 4 of mental health act, then this time you would be in hospital for part of the 8 days. So, section 4, not section 5. So, if I leave and I get brought back, it's telling me if you were already kept in hospital under section 4, never of the mental health act, then you would really be in hospital as counsel. And you do this today. Um, she's not here until another day, but you know, I have to speak to everyone. So, you know, I don't want a yes from them. Yes, Natasha, Natasha, if, you know, Natasha, if, you know, because she's black in complexion, you know, she's white, um, and I'm black, so, you know, I don't really care, because she's got a, a cool set, because she's got a book down. But, you know, it's not, it's not my position to live here. I have to speak to the other one, because, you know, they work together, it's just two people, it's a two-people job, it's not a one-person job. And this is why it matters, but, you know, it's not, because they have a bias, so, You don't care. Because I can't define hate. I can't. I can't define hate until I hate you. You see, I love you, but I don't love you. Because I can't define love either. End of story. So, what else? Let's keep us in the frame of mind of a scientist. Oh yeah. Brings me to the next point. Consensus matrix. Consensus matrix. So, the consensus matrix is literally the sparse consensus matrix of love and hate. Your love equals my hate. But, I think I'll write it down. Yes, this is my plan. So, your love equals my hate. So, this is my plan today. to go out so it's a goal plan as i showed them uh uh because hostel uh get a new car a better new car um nationwide hostel well get dressed in rafa not red with raw money from my initial black account and uh i'll go to council and request uh housing but basically i'm reading this online but i'm looking like after now from third council so i can go to third class directly or i can recover the online service um recovery service is a crucial but speak to havering um uh and uh I think that's very clear. Maybe I should have stayed one more day. Because I've got to stay one more day. I should have stayed. Anyway, speak to the hearing ahead of time. So basically, I'm going to have housing in Arafat. But Dan, I'm not going to do it for you. but I've got a lawyer involved in all this stupid nonsense but you know it's not it's not that he hates me it's just that it's just how it is in the UK so the legal matter is I'm going to Nigeria whether they like it or not you can hate me for it you can love me for it I can't define that I'm not you I'm not you I'll never be you I'll never be you I'll never be no woman like my mother no woman like my father you know because I've I've done enough for myself I've done enough to get out of this situation or not I'll never be you so as I said I do want to be detained, but, you know, I want to get housing, because I know the system, but, you know, I've been in the rules, rules are not perfect, you can break the rules, but that doesn't mean I've been in the rules. So, I'm going to get housing in Romford now, but I'm going to have to try to get a lot of housing in Romford via the Romford Council, because I want to be discharged from Romford Council, but I have to call Thorough Council to be allocated housing, to be discharged to Havering Council, because the housing is in Havering. my right to call them. To call them. To call counseling. I've been this short. They cannot say no to me on that anymore. My time has run out here. The time is very important because it fuses out like a fuse. It fuses out. It runs out. It fuses out means it runs out. It's like an implosion. The term I'm saying now is that the consensus before I go to shower, I have to go by my consensus matrix. So you get a 9x9 consensus matrix, which is like a lattice space. So 9x9 is a different model of a lattice. You get like a mesenchymal system of consensus. But there's some things in 9x9 that you need. So the lattice is basically 9x9 because you've got 3 plus 3 human rights. You've got 9x9 is 81. So 99 is 81, so it's 81. So 99 is the dimension of a point in space where that point is a 1 or 2 or 3 that are related to give you some kind of order via the lattice operation. So it's a measurement system because the lattice has a 9 by 9 system. And that represents 81 human rights. 3 plus 3, 3 times 3 is 9. 9 times 9 plus 9 plus 9 is 16. We have 15 dimensions, 15 lattices. We share 15 lattices of the universe in dimensions. So 15 lattice dimensions that interact with each other. Up, down, left, right, the dimension of space-time. via a mosaic memory model. So it's a mosaic memory model that remembers you and covers you into a system state. But basically, you're going to have to do a consensus matrix to determine what needs to hold, and you don't have to hold that thing. So for the system of what needs to hold, you cannot tell me what needs to hold. of token type, token memory, token value, and token type and token kind. And the kind of data there resulted in heterogeneous and homogeneous states of data. So I'm trying to literally have a system for a metaphysical layer of So we don't have to hold so much evolution as the meta-universe evolves. It's a digital space, but it's a metaverse. So I call it a metamorphosis. It's not silly. It's a metaverse. So it's a metaverse beyond living, which can be digitized via quantum tunneling. But it's basically instantaneous because it holds the same shared data within this physical reality and the mental reality of the mind. It's basically an astral protector with a computer, with a divisor device. The term hoarding refers to consensus hoarding. You need food, water and shelter. What are the dimensions of food, water and shelter? Sleep is the bottom one. Do you need sleep? Do animals need sleep? No. Red ants don't need sleep. They don't. But black ants do. to operate, but, you know, red ants, I've never seen a red ant shut its eyes and sleep, so I know they don't sleep, because, you know, I've been playing with them as a child, for experimentation, but the red ants are literally the things that don't sleep, don't need to sleep, they don't have that, so sleep is not needed in their consensus reality of being an ant, so, you know, but, you know, the ant's model is basically, you know, as we're human beings, so we can lose the dimension if we don't have that model of consensus, because we need to eat, sleep, and poo, and I need to sleep So it's basically how to protect myself into a state of being via consensus holding, holding a kind of system of accountability. Because you get a negative space where you share and you don't need it, you don't need to hold it, which is rift triplet. So rift triplet is basically rift problem. Breathing is not optional. Living is not optional. Only working is optional. So my love is your hate. I cannot define, I cannot define, I cannot define I love to hate you in my framework of Igbo man, my sovereignty. But these are terms that intertwine. Because love is hate. Because if there's love, there's this hate. And that's what you need to love. That's what you need to love yourself. I love myself. I love me. O-B-I, which is the persona of me. I love me. Eze, which is another persona of me. And I love you, me. Me, myself, and I. I love I. Uche. But this is in the own reality. So these are three people that are called Namdi. When you say, I love you, Nnamdi. No one said that to me before, and I'm very glad about that. So, it is not a dystopian. It is a reality I share, and I have to manage with the paperwork. But I love myself, so because I'm from Nigeria, I'm not British. What I'm saying is, the kind of consensus matrix I'm inventing is 27. But it's 9 plus 3. 9 to the power of 3. not 19 straight because that defines the shared space that needs to hold at the time and that's 27 we don't need to hold 27 units of diameters that which is lattice and it's mosaic so obviously it's color-coded it's color-coded spins of quantum numbers um it's color-coded of quantum qubits that determine the color of a solar system of um of non-linear no polarity uh because non-polarity means that there's no sequence of instructions that's linear and you have a pathway you don't have a specific definition it's called a system that's not polar and it's non-linear but it's polar but it's not you cannot have a non-polarity you have an inverse non-polar but you can have every unit you move on but it's like a game if you don't know i'm saying it's like a video game so in a video game you have ways you can go but you can have rigid controllers so you can in that game, no glitch spot. So that's what prevents every pathway you should perform, every path you go, every shape you take. If you become, if you've got a quality streak, your quality doesn't glitch, and you can have a cooldown, and you know, it doesn't matter what the game is, whatever you take is preserved, via consensus is needed to preserve something that's basically and because this is what you need uh permission requires authority uh but you need permission there's no authority in my framework for it because you don't need permission this is a one it's not an eight it could and should happen because it could doesn't mean you should you should it should does not mean it would you have would happen either so she could should would would you do it yes or no well could i do it yes maybe would i do this and you go to wouldn't I do it? But that's the permission of the Trident permission. So the permission has Trident model, three models that you get. The consent. Could I have sex? No. I want sex. No. I need to have sex. No. But the goal of this is to have the consent shared. And the only consent is shared. So the consent of a peer-to-peer people, two people ask them, of a peer-to-peer topology is a consent framework. So the consent is what the OB contract is also, you know, consent to. So that's the OB-S contract. So peer-to-peer or bus, which is like a... the bus topology, which is like the topology of having a bus network topology. The indictment of a systemic epidemic IP address them. IP address them. So IP address them is because it's a concept of a kind of system of having the non-polarity boot sequence of OBSS. It is defined. It's polar defined. But it's needed. It's consensus is needed. You don't want that part to be there. It's just needed to have a response to that service. It's not the kind of rigidity of computer systems in the framework of open access. But the good part of open access is every part, way, shape, or form, there is a solution to your problem because the problem is defined. to show your quantum spin. And that's why that works that way though. It's not hard to do. It's just that you have to find an array and give everything an array of quantum spin. No matter if it's a spit and that person is really supervision and interference to solve that problem so you can take any data you want um uh any data but you have to get that rate to be non-rated so diary has a solution in a search space and that's the person who has a tomographic which is an area over a pi pi pi over four pi over three pi over two and pi for one which is pi get the system resolve itself tomographically via the area of radium which is pi over 180 and pi over 270 million times there's some degree some angle pi of 180 times some angle like 45 degrees or 25 degrees and now reserve the surface of the
