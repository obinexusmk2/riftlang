Unknown Speaker  0:00  
We could now forget it new.

Unknown Speaker  0:05  
So let me tell this property testable. This is interpretation for spa graph

Unknown Speaker  0:13  
for tomography. Is it flexible?

Unknown Speaker  0:22  
You

Unknown Speaker  0:57  
activity. Okay, so basically, what am I doing here? I have to just search Jordan keep quiet.

Unknown Speaker  1:05  
Stop. Oh, my pleasure

Unknown Speaker  1:10  
is

Unknown Speaker  1:29  
Hmm, so what am I doing now? Nnamdi,

Unknown Speaker  1:38  
what am I doing? My video shows, a video on

Unknown Speaker  1:54  
see

Unknown Speaker  2:12  
I

Unknown Speaker  2:17  
mean, okay, bro.

Unknown Speaker  2:28  
Up. So

Unknown Speaker  2:33  
basically this image on the This one's Nnamdi. So it's like a table one girl of my avatar,

Unknown Speaker  2:41  
but it's like Nam being cutting from it's not puppet cutting dark skin glasses, smart avatar. This was called My heart logo, my circle up image on behalf in the house and stuff. Cover, nothing else and stuff August into the five, and it's like water security. This also typically a problem. You know, it's never like a it's a budget certificate for change, but I'm gonna make the change unless you follow my channel. I really okay if you follow or not.

Unknown Speaker  3:20  
But this my English update, but also rift test, operate update, so I'm trying to make it 30 minutes or less good. So you got this, you go rift riff, which is a rift is a flag with translator, but you got a rift test.

Unknown Speaker  3:38  
Rift test, which is the testing library for rift. But you see, it's about rooftop really. But why is rift of power? Just like it's not in here for now, but I'll show you why the roof Test, test library. So this the roof test, but it seems like just, but, you know, I'll come back to that later. It's just what is about roof test you get to get Rift, which can do a lot of things based on it starts scoring.

Unknown Speaker  4:06  
Basically, this is the model consciousness doing stuff like energy. But, you know, go with this, the testing loved one. So this is very important to do it properly.

Unknown Speaker  4:15  
So I want to show you the repository I'm working on. So you got the R, capital, R underscore open, which is the rest open. Basically it's a program they can run to open any kind of this we get political, but it's like the license you get to run.

Unknown Speaker  4:38  
It gets the conjugate model.

Unknown Speaker  4:41  
It's about this testing. So basically, I know this via the rest test library. So R open is the library you can go to see r open. We can download this here to this one. So what's video important? Why is it important?

Unknown Speaker  4:57  
Shut up a new job. Sorry. Aza, no, keep quiet. You don't do your job. You're not doing nothing. No, don't start.

Unknown Speaker  5:09  
Basically, my

Unknown Speaker  5:15  
video. You're my friend as a sorry. So basically, risk test is so roof test is like the testing library for roof, but it's like

Unknown Speaker  5:31  
roof test also testing library, but it was something called filter flash from top. So when you filter something, you're sorting out, you're organizing it, you're trying to process it, because you do some kind of competition on it, which is like a star scoring graph. Filtering is an interpretation of a system, state, openness, division. So when you finish something, you're interpreting it. When you run some kind of function.

Unknown Speaker  6:02  
Can be log n, can be log n over log n, space, time, boundary, whatever filtering is like, you know, the default for, like a filtering sorting out, searching stuff on, searching algorithms, sorting algorithms,

Unknown Speaker  6:18  
merging algorithms, merge anything that is not a flash, any pure filter can be it's not flash because the filter is only for processing if it's in process has a flash to get the filter flash quality.

Unknown Speaker  6:35  
But you know, the rift test is basically get a flash. If I start with a corner piece of a puzzle already flashed. This started service platform input

Unknown Speaker  6:47  
seat on

Unknown Speaker  6:48  
robots to make the full image. What is the starship manner or the bottom ocean on this images here the filter flash filters are bi directional at the bank minimum. But you know you can busy when you flash something, you store it, but you know it's tridactic because it works in a function. So it can flash anything. Flash can be into a fixture. Anything can be a flash via try that extra sparse modeling. But who's just works on tomography. So what are you about that? So basically, imagine, I want to pack something, but I don't know the state of that system, but I can probably guess the state. I can guess the state of that system. No, I want to buy an IP address by good IP. Just really, it's a static IP, just it's done, but I have the website, URL, you know, URL set, but URL set is dynamic, so it reroutes me to some kind of stick, but they don't see basically, like, hack me, hack me, hack the box dog or hack me, hack me, hack me. But now you know, hack me that has an IP address, 198126,

Unknown Speaker  8:01  
0.1, I one. This the UK, you know, UK regions, but some kind of region, UK business, some kind of state I was in. But, you know, this is still hackable, because it doesn't matter where I am, the UK having me done now doesn't allow us. So if I know this my state and how the geomorphic system setup, I can still break the lattice, basically change the alignment. Picking a lock,

Unknown Speaker  8:29  
basically insane. Select systems are rigid rules. But you know, I can still break a diamond system, because it's like picking a lock, the lock might the lock might change the pain, changing the pain so after pick a location to automate some kind of services. I can break the IP again because at least one spec appears in that timing framework.

Unknown Speaker  8:49  
It doesn't matter what. It's not fully sparse. It's not sparse, but just dynamic. Does rerouting, which I'm good for. So you get 198 number two. So basically this like a IP free for address. If I type in this IP for address, I should be able to get those site. But, you know, the site is just, point is this approach is a pointer system this IP address, which I'm saying because, so the idea of this is

Unknown Speaker  9:15  
just ensure that, via consensus modeling with like a try direct, yes, yes, yes, you're allowed permission. Yes, yes, yes, you allowed consent. Yes, you allowed consensus to do some thoughts. Yeah, dynamic tomography, exposure. But, you know, I'm trying to make sure it's good. So how does work in practice? So you can have a relay attack. Now, what is a

Unknown Speaker  9:37  
really attack? What is a really attack? A really attack. It's like, you know, you know a system state, you know, some kind of arbitrary state, you know, you basically, you have noise, you have a day noise, but then I suppose some signal, or your signal. So your noise is your signal. So, you know, you know some states, that's, you know, no one knows. So example, obviously realistic is like,

Unknown Speaker  9:59  
say, I can observe something. I can measure it 100% but I can put it back no matter, no matter what the attack is that we need. For example, I send the same signal back to the system. The system has to process it, picking up, switching. You know, we have a bike lock. You receive the bike lock. You pick the lock configuration. You know, inside door lock doesn't matter the Master Lock, you know, because you put your your key in or your screwdriver in, you then push right, go through some combination, left, right, and you know the lock, you start to get more information. You know, because you know, the lock allows you to mechanically twist. It just allows to be broken. Is like Same thing here, because you have here, because you see what you're doing without by knowing the state of the system. You know, get more information. But obviously, if you know half information, if you know what else you know, half already, because there's some kind of chemical Spanish University to order kind of block. What is a master lock? If there's no master lock, that system is perfect, because you have the twin key in that system. But if it's a master key, is a master lock. So the idea here is, like, contiguous observer example, like, you know, if I'm basically, if I have to signal the noise, I can server the signal without consensus. But basically the idea here is, I've got Celine scale, the observer consumer model for sparse interpretation, which is the flash function mapping. So you get the functor two to one, two data of functions to one output, and that one output has two other one or two other functions.

Unknown Speaker  11:40  
So you get two, one, an important picture. If you have a cheapest thing, space,

Unknown Speaker  11:44  
if you have a space time function, install two, two outputs.

Unknown Speaker  11:51  
The space is some storage of the biggest and time is the car, the time

Unknown Speaker  11:56  
5050, megabytes.

Unknown Speaker  12:02  
Half time. In five seconds.

Unknown Speaker  12:06  
This time 50 is a login. Basically get 15, 5050, megabytes, how much one bytes it with?

Unknown Speaker  12:19  
One megabyte is a one, 1001 megabyte, one kilobyte. And 211,

Unknown Speaker  12:30  
1000 kilobytes.

Unknown Speaker  12:33  
Let's say you get 50 kilobytes. There's a five,

Unknown Speaker  12:36  
five KB, unless you get 50 kilobytes, megabytes, and that's one good all the time, so fast it goes. But you know, just like even good enough. Okay, a kilo is 1000 to get 5000 kilobytes.

Unknown Speaker  12:53  
Let's see 5500 5000 kilobytes. If you get one megabyte, kilobyte over the time of half 60 seconds, 30 seconds, that'll be

Unknown Speaker  13:04  
five over three, 1.3 occurring megabytes. And that's idea to

Unknown Speaker  13:10  
get some kind of function, because tomography is the key. Tomography is the key, the idea you look in the inside, for example, you have some kind of volume.

Unknown Speaker  13:24  
Basically, you are trying to how to you have, like a cube, like a sphere. You have the sphere, you have the area.

Unknown Speaker  13:32  
You have the surface area. We try to figure out the volume density, so it is like so for example, what

Unknown Speaker  13:40  
that means is like this. You get what I

Unknown Speaker  13:42  
mean, get. So what that means, that means

Unknown Speaker  13:48  
two pi r2, pi r2, pi r is a surface. The radius is 100 100 1000 100 meters, miles, meters, 100 feet, 10 100 feet, on the feet. And then the reduce is 50

Unknown Speaker  14:09  
centimeters, 50 100 feet. And then you get the PI 3.14 and you get the two pi, two times pi. And that is like 3.14 3.14

Unknown Speaker  14:24  
so you get 100 100,000

Unknown Speaker  14:29  
100 100,000 centimeters. You don't know this. You need know the area, which is just this components which have to pick the lock to try to get a component that this confusing me. So this comes down, you get some kind of conversion,

Unknown Speaker  14:47  
for example, let me work it out. Mr. 1000, 100 or 1000.

Unknown Speaker  14:56  
Get the calculator. It's a good online calculator here. 100 here's

Unknown Speaker  15:07  
times pi times pi, times pi, times pi is what times three four. So that's 314 now

Unknown Speaker  15:18  
between the 40 centimeters is not a square personal volume. So that's the parameter. See, you know, you get the cheap items to get them to get 162

Unknown Speaker  15:31  
68 3185, or 62185.

Unknown Speaker  15:37  
You know, six, 361, with like a cinemas q squared perimeter, how much you go on the perimeter, but you have to have some kind of function that's a pretty similar for one unit, for one go of the radius, you get the unit model. Sorry, sorry,

Unknown Speaker  15:55  
Lisa. So for when you go to

Unknown Speaker  15:58  
one unit, you go two units away, select them out dynamically

Unknown Speaker  16:06  
without telling them to lock them out. Basically that idea,

Unknown Speaker  16:10  
it's normal to make this what's good to make it

Unknown Speaker  16:20  
so that I did a tomography, used to test it, no matter if the R open repository are open, is birth bound by tomography, which is the observing. Basically, if I send a signal, a chemical signal, their chemical signal, I observe their state. But you know, it doesn't mean it. I give them no noise, no noise and no signal.

Unknown Speaker  16:46  
But I use this propagation of the states, the equilibrium all the states. They can't measure this. This just this, just noise to them. There's nothing here. You can see this, their noise. You can detect this, just like a me trying to go. I just have some kind of take a medium. This is a medium to them. It's not in here. So when I get a signal, their signal, I can replay it backwards in that way. Basically I can replace so the medium provision, medium, no noise, no signal. It's like an insecure channel, because I'm already, already, I create this channel myself, and signals through a window. But, you know, the

Unknown Speaker  17:24  
signals are digital, so 01010201,

Unknown Speaker  17:29  
for some time, and then one up, the one down. You know, it's basically digital noise, but that's remove byte 101, this is reverse. This is like a bound to how I measure, how I polarize the thing so I can get my meal, or I can start

Unknown Speaker  17:52  
do

Unknown Speaker  18:07  
stuff, really system.

Unknown Speaker  18:16  
Way you get some recording. This is just saying, just sending all information to some encoding configuration that is passed to unlock the system. But for me, you already know the model, so you don't,

Unknown Speaker  18:40  
so that's like, it doesn't allow fragmentation, because the system already,

Unknown Speaker  18:50  
so that it's like, so work by you Defining what I call a sparse

Unknown Speaker  19:02  
focus the block. Now, uh, so it's all programs. You get the Buckner form

Unknown Speaker  19:06  
Buckner, which is the Hamiltonian edge bound

Unknown Speaker  19:11  
Hamiltonian

Unknown Speaker  19:13  
node, bound beta node and coding node structure basically.

Unknown Speaker  19:21  
And you get it investable. So basically, if the Schumer bites this positive, you you have measuring the negative. Basically, you're listening because it for you. Because, you know, usually, if it's positive, you are observing negative. So, but you know it's positive because, you know, someone says secure, you know, using reverse. Last ecology here. So if you get like a 01 you are, this means a 101, you are reversing this. So you are, you can 00120, on the left side. Once you get a once your means, means one zero. So this thing is what you need begin again. So the button of form is the standard Polish notation for passing for your breakfast or difference so you have like the shimmer bites, 10110112345678,

Unknown Speaker  20:22  
breaths. You know, this can be serious. It can be a duplex string you never know, respond always. Can be

Unknown Speaker  20:29  
one string.

Unknown Speaker  20:34  
You just send one we don't know, don't get so you have to work with so how will this look like if I receive a zero, I know to 00101, I

Unknown Speaker  20:44  
have to show this is either encoding some kind of information.

Unknown Speaker  20:52  
This actually some data and some data, or some awesome transformation, or some kind of law, also IP, I don't know what it says. You know, start to put 20 together.

Unknown Speaker  21:06  
So this can be 1234567, so what is me? So I know this number. It's just an arbitrary thing. I don't really know what it is, but I know some data, so I can start collecting information I'm piecing together.

Unknown Speaker  21:18  
So in this room, it gives me mean

Unknown Speaker  21:22  
nothing. Preferences references. So this will be 01, will be 00, left with one right foot, zero, left with one right new

Unknown Speaker  21:36  
left foot, left

Unknown Speaker  21:41  
foot. Forward, left, rooter. I mean, go up one chain left.

Unknown Speaker  21:49  
This is sanitary, so 01001,

Unknown Speaker  21:55  
for backup, left.

Unknown Speaker  22:01  
You go, you put on the left nose, go left one, and you go right. Go. You go right.

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
This is back now you go to right, root left.

Unknown Speaker  22:11  
So that's the number reverse button. So this is zero, right to be one,

Unknown Speaker  22:20  
zero, left,

Unknown Speaker  22:25  
right. This will be

Unknown Speaker  22:29  
010, and this would be so basically get the opposite here in the model. This is back now, so this should be at the same one, just opposite. So this is the repetition of the go to program using coding.

Unknown Speaker  22:44  
So this will mean, here that you know, left node. So if I use a breathless search algorithm, I start with the bottom. So this will be 0101

Unknown Speaker  22:57  
can either mean 0101 because that's the oh, that's weekly. The breadth first, the bottom node, 0101,

Unknown Speaker  23:09  
for Buckner type one can mean either 0101, so information there and they will go on some one, zero,

Unknown Speaker  23:19  
get three section, the same thing. Get another 10110, and you go to 01,

Unknown Speaker  23:27  
basically the same thing.

Unknown Speaker  23:29  
So if I get a 10146,

Unknown Speaker  23:35  
so I want to I get a number 45666016,

Unknown Speaker  23:41  
is 0161,

Unknown Speaker  23:46  
she gets number seven.

Unknown Speaker  23:47  
Yeah, seven, two. So get so busy. This can mean seven in binary.

Unknown Speaker  23:53  
You get some the top one you're meant to reach from the bottom. Or do I know, usually seven, either way. So, because you get this will be 0123,

Unknown Speaker  24:07  
because, you know, one in the two, please, two, two into one, please. One in the two, please. And one in the three place should be three. This will be 131, either seven or four, you know? So I get two observation channel was possible in this, including seven or four in bark offer. Now it's

Unknown Speaker  24:28  
done so the other one is a missing number four, seven, the in a in reverse Polish process, like what reverse Polish is what it's like.

Unknown Speaker  24:45  
But you know that you see some kind of internal structure of the system. It doesn't matter what it is. It has to fix some kind of its own principles of protocol. So basically, you are into similar system, but you're not really trying to assess, you trying to get as much information before you actually do something. So

Unknown Speaker  25:05  
basically, it's work here. So I'm trying to maximize this. Now, guys, let me just maximize this. I don't want to put some time to make your full screen fit the screen.

Unknown Speaker  25:18  
So it's like this. You see this? Yeah.

Unknown Speaker  25:21  
Associate personal client do

Unknown Speaker  25:25  
nothing.

Unknown Speaker  25:30  
So that's okay. So the bump number,

Unknown Speaker  25:33  
which is just roots, left, right, left, depending on the NGS of the system, because computers are so positive, but you know, it's just there as a motion, As more human

Unknown Speaker  25:56  
friendly

Unknown Speaker  25:59  
for encryption. So the idea you link is so what that means the homogeneous is the same means that they work. They do the same job. They try to find the power.

Unknown Speaker  26:18  
But, you know, different properties. So a node can have a density, but density is not a width. It's not width. Which is what it has to do the node can have a density can be like a 0.7 meaning, if you back a node up 0.7 damages, especially more important.

Unknown Speaker  26:42  
Which because you notice dependent dependency, that's very important, or some kind of a system, chemical shift, standard damping factor, if you know it has a dump factor of the effect. It's very important because one minus t5 the effect,

Unknown Speaker  27:10  
which would be two, five, sure,

Unknown Speaker  27:17  
the algorithm runs the temperature half equilibrium, because, you know, it's more important to do something than which. So basically, doing defense is

Unknown Speaker  27:29  
revolutions that bridges vision for sparse from a profit.

Unknown Speaker  27:36  
So the idea is, you define some kind of function,

Unknown Speaker  27:44  
some kind of function duality to show Hamiltonian for synchronization, because if your Hamiltonian position is Easter east of school, you

Unknown Speaker  27:57  
got the opposite one to do it.

Unknown Speaker  28:00  
So the edge bound one is different from the example, if the Hamiltonian cycle, it's going clockwise the universe,

Unknown Speaker  28:19  
Operation blooming that's how the relationship works. Obviously, if you're seeing, if you're seeing a very system, you're processing it until you can cut up because, you know, you can use a different channel that the

Unknown Speaker  28:35  
image, you just absorb the seriousness, if it's in area, but you know, if you have a feeling system, you have to model it. But if you, if you continue, if you defeat on a data set, or what you think is chemical and there were the data detected you too, so you are not fully invisible.

Unknown Speaker  28:57  
How to mirror the system perfectly and be, be the listening.

Unknown Speaker  29:04  
So it doesn't matter the IP addresses. It just matters the queue. Is a queue and easy stack. That term is currently Q, to stack the Q, or just rotated queue of symbols of data.

Unknown Speaker  29:27  
So

Unknown Speaker  29:47  
so,

Unknown Speaker  29:51  
016767010167,
