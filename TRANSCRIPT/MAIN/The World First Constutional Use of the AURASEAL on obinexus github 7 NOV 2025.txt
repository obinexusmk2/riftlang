System audio. Okay, my heart is not here. But 
system no mahal is going to be here. Uh system audio recording. Okay guys, uh today's video is 
going to be on sale. It's my genz cryptography algorithm that I made uh for I have to write 
that image to I want to show you the email. I   don't really care about showing you the email to 
stuff my business email. But we have to start with Oral seal. Uh, what is an oral seal? Uh, 
my basically I'm with a pencil right now and I don't want to write with a pencil. I 
want to write with a pen. A pen. A pen. Oh, this is a pen. It's a gel pen. Okay. Basically, 
an aura seal is a cryptography algorithm. An aura seal is a cryptographic algorithm. Uh, it has 
aura. Basically, it's the aura of someone or some system like you know the aura of the entropy 
system. The aura is the entropy, the amount of hope. uh you wish you know uh so you know say I 
have like the council let me use an example they   lost 700 million pounds homeless uh 2014 uh I was 
homeless about January uh they used the aura of 700 million to make me homeless deny me a house 
under act 2014 which is a free thing in anyway um so for my master became homeless in November 
when I emir to thorough council and uh some supported housing in uh in uh AK supported housing 
in uh uh AK supported housing where I was being molested, harassing, abused by social service and 
stuff. I was 23 years old then now I'm 24 years old now I was basically at least 10,000 pounds 
homeless November I stayed in best person in uh and 29 November to 28 January. So this is the 
birth of the oral seal. Okay. So basically the oh I haven't got my image here. Okay. Uh, let me get 
the image there. Uh, let me see where I can get   the picture of the actual logo. Oh, sorry guys. 
It's kind of like uh this is not insignia. So, this is the documentation uh how it works. Uh, 
but what is that poem? No, I don't show you the poem. I just want to show you the this is code 
everything. Uh, but I don't want to show you the poem. I just want to show you the image. imaged. 
So basically the image here this an insignia. This is why I believe an insignia is uh can you can 
see uh oh here you can see it. I I really hope you can see this image here. This going to see this 
like uh as a child oh wait as a child I journey I hope you can see it actually. Uh as a child I 
journey through um as a child um I wondered uh this is a child incibility symbol. uh workbook um 
I journeyed uh I walked in a path uh in reflection of myself my autism there's a positive part 
you know also reflection of who I am a mirror of reflection of who I am who is nam who's been 
who's Michael I became an adult uh I turned 18 I didn't get a house you know as an institution 
everything basically this is one aura um this is just the aura one so the this reflection of 
the shield so basically It's an insignia. This   a manifestation. It's called an insignia. Know 
basically anything that manifests, that's a new meaning, a new beginning. Something that comes 
through. That's an insignia. That's something   new. That's inside. That's something that's 
something new. That's something um you aura, you know. Uh everything has an end, everything 
has a beginning. It's a cycle. You know,   it doesn't matter what you destroy, something 
consequ I don't know science unless you prove this not. So this is just the hero's journey. So 
basically, as a child, subject never mind talking about this because it's hard for me to talk about 
it's not hard for me to talk about because I can   solve my problem you know this is why solving this 
is algorithm so the algorithm here has aura so this is the aura this like negative aura you know 
you have negative rare negative um aura you know we don't want to be around you this is just jz uh 
this is just as an adult uh I become an adult so basically to return a king uh this is a reflection 
of who I am I return an adult as I journey back you see what's going forward what was going And 
it's not very clear, but this is meant to be going   back. This arrows pointing the other way. I become 
a child. Uh to return a king. Uh no no I think I made basically I made a mistake here cuz this uh 
I join it back. This just meant to be the opposite of of this. No, this is the first one. I got lazy 
cuz I love basically I run out of space but this is just me opposite one. Doesn't show it. So this 
is the land. It's all mine cuz I'm king of ine. So for me this is my aura. This the manifestation 
in second is the beginning. But you know you got   to understand all these symbols mean something. 
It's an emblem if you want. This insignia this an like an en sign insignia with an e that's 
like the manifestation of um think of like making inquiry. You enter something you make 
request and you fail. So this is a sign I made when I was 18 when I got into um so basically 
uh I didn't sign up for just put me in there. So I didn't go winning late. So I wasn't I was 
inside you know I was I was inside but without my work and this I'm now leaving social care 
25 if I turn 25 I become an inside and then and then when I leave when I leave I become an 
ensign the end sign will like uh come through   um here and this like as a child an adult as a 
king. So basically this is a child becoming an adult this king in Eb everything. So this is an 
inside. Now this is going all the way backwards but you know as a child adult child blah blah blah 
repeats repeat comes here it goes back but this me repeat reflection of my autism diver who I am 
and you see this a middle man the man with the line is all mine this is what this means you 
know this is incib inscrib but I love incidi basically my main position is going to be in 
bfra uh because I'm trying to uh make it a firm uh everything will decentralize we don't want 
the of monopoly all that stupid jargon they do by talking and harassing people when they want 
to go the streets and you know I am thinking of um basically everything get proof anyway when 
it comes to bre constitution but the ban oha uh which is like oha means public oa is how 
you say oh I w means uh law public law now you got public law services uh everything but 
the law is not good enough so everything is Go   low and order. So you go lower order low order. 
But I want to s to low order enforcement. But I don't want to do that yet because it's sector 
model. Uh so we got public law. Uh public uh public law or now public order I ja that's law 
and order framework. So human rights art 51 is all low. The enforcement of the countries are 
older. that I got a high but the question is about the howation of this so with an aura so 
guys I want you guys to see your aura you know for me it's going back to be bfra you know bra 
means come and mean it's going back to and this is just a manifestation of that insignia 
you know it's it's about the the system   uh understanding you and you solving your problem 
your beginning middle and end you know journey how you got to leave uh maybe uh turn off my camera 
uh for a second. Maybe I can pause this video. No, I cannot pause this video. Okay. Uh let me just u 
take a leak and I'll come back. It's unfiltered,   guys. I just shut my camera down. Let me 
just go. Uh I'm going to be pissing now. Okay, don't guys. It's kind of 
weird. Like you guys seen the Okay, I'm back now. So, okay. Okay. So, basically, so basically guys, I'm 
back. Uh, let's continue our pickup. So, the thing I'm saying to you is like the problem is the the 
whole Nigerian ecosystem. It's so fragmented and   uh it's kind of bureaucratic. um you know just 
point of even living in a country we have a petition uh but what I'm saying to you is like u 
yeah it's like a uh we're going to have everything there uh as a sector model health and social care 
sector so we don't fragment someone like you know don't fragment because you know sol this problem 
sector works it works and it works it works I swear it especially when you prove it so basically 
I'm going to show you what I mean now but I don't I don't want to dwell on health and social care 
sector everything will be bound by sectors to   change that anything you know if everybody has a 
health issue in terms of social care as well if a design issue technology sector everything uh if 
the basically open design and technology company doing computer science but I'm doing um what else 
am I doing I'm doing care next year if I get a   chance to do it but um uh after my PhD hopefully 
but I don't want to do because I want to focus on the the the building the artifacts and neurodyiver 
people first uh but That's more better for me because I want to do that computers and my type of 
computers for new diver people like me. Uh so what is an oral seal? So basically or is just in when 
you said oh maybe we should get through the email. Okay. Let me see if I can find it here guys. 
Huh? Uh it should be here. 7day something. Yeah. So this is I hope you guys can see my screen. I 
don't know. I don't know. Oh, you guys can't see my screen. Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But 
where's my screen being recorded? I think I see   my screen. I don't know. Stop. Welcome recording. 
Okay, guys, let me see. Let me see whether you can see this insignia. Let me just see whether you can 
see this insignia here. Oh, I hope you can. I hope you can. I I really hope you can. I don't want 
you any problems you guys to see it anyway. So, where is the copy images path? Uh, I hope you 
can see this here. Now this just inside here uh but where screen recording uh settings uh hope you 
can see this I don't want to edit this again make this video again and again again again uh take a 
screenshot uh click and drag of video recording so this is a screenshot here I'm going to post it 
but this is called an oras this going to called sale this an image notation oh I can draw on it uh 
uh okay I do real time okay let me close this now uh it's still recording good good this is a screen 
recorder okay so now I want to show you the other thing uh what screen is recording actually view 
all screenshot is uh okay now basically I want to show you what the org this is a quick algorith 
basically insign is an inquiry uh but you know it's like the word an inquiry is like a you go you 
have to be part of the sector to make an inquiry um to HR human resources etc Uh inside it's like 
that. uh you you go out you inside something you go out and do it yourself or you um inside you 
from inside you make a manifestation you bridge a branch off for the change you know that's the 
same uh basically same thing as uh the implode so implode in water something implodes you know 
in water but outside it explodes it explodes and there's change you know something changes and you 
get something new happen uh that's what I'm saying to you guys okay now now now let me show you the 
other Now let me show you the other thing. Uh uh basically I'm looking for something. Yes. Uh what 
am I looking for? Yes. The seven. Yes. The first use of the oral shell. If I don't if I don't 
if I never do this I I would never uh show. So basically I should be a PDF document. I I hope 
I did uh send it. Oh well. Okay guys hope you can see this PDF document here. This is the first 
use for the uh when council lo I paid them to give him my house. It cost me 200 return on investment 
and I leave this first constitutional utopia. Your aura has been sealed guys. All right. I'm making 
legacy here. So basically this is just the example I'm going to give. As a young adult I journey 
through the bureaucracies of the system that   oppress harass and failed the generation Z leaving 
them behind. I returned them in reflection of uch knowledge and essay king think of as obi heart and 
soul to rebuild the infrastructure that failed an entire generation masquerading within the m to 
seal the aura of what was broken to begin with. For what is yet to be I became my time is now. I 
now build what must heal us all by the official first use of constitutional humanentric uh first 
uh work and life show or sale uh this form. So this ora sale this is your message you know every 
time you uh do something you give them a stupid give them an email uh for my request and you send 
them an or sale now this is just 7day the deadline for unredacted um uh 2018 followup uh human rights 
override I'm already I'm over everything you know my money but this is what it means the stupid 
so basically hey this is my j voice I was doing masking know my way on us next They could think 
about signing a document for me. You were banned from my business. What do you think? Who do you 
think people are? Anyone has a complaint, send it   to my business email. Now I I'll never be like 
you people and I'll deal with them personally. Just send me email. I'm not your friends. Let me 
reckon it or go to court or the national court. Do your job. That's my policy enforcement. Don't 
be sorry for the person to be. And you know when basically this is just I'm saying example email 
can read it at the textbooks entries repository. uh but you know this example I want to change 
you know the insignia the inside everything you   know I want to ensure you guys understand how to 
use your aura sale I'm thinking have basically if you have an aura sale you know you are part of 
a change something that's new something that's   branching off the system that broke you and 
that's what I'm saying to you guys understand why this made image is so im meaning to me you 
know you can have the obx logo everything OBS but you know if something fails we have to change 
it you know and that's what I'm saying to you the   aura cell is that change you know you have to be 
part of that team part of that sector you know to form a new division and you can ensure people are 
complying whatever I was there education strength I was gay mentor country crap just no this this is 
just a oh come so basically guys this one's my uh pigeon voice uh this is pigeon nami so basically 
I when something goes wrong uh I get a new persona so I get I am Obi Nami I'm talking to you nice 
nicely uh obs E obi is knowledge is king no uj's knowledge means knowledge in ebo and is king the 
for obi means heart soul when I'm with people that comply with my business firm so I'm going to 
make a firm in the future but you know the the thing I'm saying to you this is pretty ningy uh 
education stress still I get 2% in the club me no give back request I don't care I come for the next 
um education reform I need data for PDA protect officers protect office just my bank account 
I leave those social care you know I'm talking to them in my pigeon voice now the pigeon voice is 
like a pigeon English but um I can spell it like a pigeon as in p i d g i n as in the language pigeon 
as in lang but I'm talking to them because I'm a business my business object so if you get a good 
side you get ob to Whether you like it or not, you know the right but my voice don't fix 
you know you understand you know my come to you for now you know my pigeon they they make 
you solve problem you know what you put in my email everything this is the avatar system you 
know so basically what what you do basically what you do wrong you speak pigeon what you know 
you do right now good side by side aub.com/obat they know me for sure now get me stupid email 
nothing but this is the email I'm sending them I'm being honest this is my number I don't want you 
guys to call me no ghosting policy basically my   um my policy for my firms is based on um 
everything is if then because you know we don't really understand the uh the whole if is like um 
if something happens then you go to something else but else you go if then else uh the then close 
it's like the the close the catch so if basically There's this is based on the um the concept of 
like um uh uh like you know the founders promise. So the the foundation and aspiration goals. So if 
the foundation if the if the expression goals are   not met we then uh and we have a problem in the 
foundational go basically we have to keep track observing the foundational goals you know because 
it's like uh witnessing state. So you have a can board I'm gating something I have a task I 
separate the two foundational aspirational uh and I'll come up to that. So this is here on my on 
my thing. I haven't taken a picture of it. Uh but you know this is like um the one. So I make a new 
video of the or uh but the G&D voices are pigeon Nami and Obi Nami. You know Obi Nami you know 
that's the one you're going to hear for me on the   social media. OBI means hot or soul. Obi means and 
that's the one you're going to hear for me most of the time. You know, unless you my bad side, I just 
stop talking pigeon you know and be obvious angry you know something wrong you know and you know 
you know they vex me no more but pigeon has good ones you know and this my avatar so you get with 
a pigeon which is my two avatars my two sides but everything's two so I want you guys to use the 
openex avatar repository github.com and try to create your own authentic avatar especially for 
social media interactions you know you know you   know when you get angry you don't just be the 
perfect um person they expect you to You you have you're dynamic, you have emotions. But this 
I'm going to show you too. So let me just try to   do this one here. So I got my paper here. Uh two 
uh I got so this is the hidden cipher. This why works. This is my business email. So introduction 
for two millennials are pondered the existence of   odd perfect numbers for perfect numbers are equal 
to the sum of the proper divisor. While perfect numbers are wellknown documents no perfect odd 
perfect have ever come uh solved. Uh basically   a perfect number this was about uh introduction to 
perfect numbers. But a perfect number is a number that's equal or in some including some. So it's 
like a it's like an even basically what perfect number is even but you know the there's never seen 
an uh odd perfect number. It's like do they exist at all? And this is the whole this is a big thing 
in in cryptography as well. Uh uh system depend on the precise relationship between key pairs. 
Uh this is my uh cryptographic interpretation. A public key and key pair for example must 
align with a perfect secure communication.   the strength is the encryption lies in the vector 
integrity of those keys you know uh basically the I'm saying to you the integrity of the keys 
are based on the um uh the precise ratio of the paired keys you know how they how they uh resolve 
the state uh um like an odd perfect number uh can be viewed as a basically as an odd perfect number 
could be viewed as a result of key pair you know the the odd like having an odd number is the it's 
like you know the prime numbers uh the primeration um of those numbers must be intact um in whether 
the the sum of the proper divisor must equal the number itself um if any factor the encryption 
breaks you know so that's be seis alignment with the system so what is I'm trying to introduce 
you to something called an oral seal algorithm now this is just about computation and computation 
so basically kind of have um so basically if   the if you have like a broken al MD5 they have um 
something called a factor off so the factor off is like you know you have some kind of way you kind 
ofum um some kind of permutation or combination   that resides in um the system misaligning you know 
uh I have a pattern about this um but you know the this is the first aura sale I'm talking about 
or 5 github.com/ob nexs for/ A for aura u for umbrella r for romeo e for alpha s for sarah e 
for echo a for alpha al for lima 512 which is 512 hexis you know that just mean two calculus 
the thing about the Oral cell guys you got to understand that it's about equilibrium you know 
seamless alignment especially in quantum systems you know the alignment is like I have got one 
implementation I haven't done that yet but I   can make a classicalation so first of all has two 
uh two to one mapping between public and private it's a full field system so you can have a public 
key as a or you can have a a public key as an or uh but you know that public key can be a photo 
have two have two public keys uh to one private key and one private key to one public keys 
you know uh okay you know depending on what   you need it for you know you on zero uh interface 
zero call zero knowledge proof systems you know zero what I made you know you don't need to um uh 
you don't need to store any data you just need to um check that the computer understands the the 
validity of that statement you know that's what that's what a zero call interf zero inter 
um zero knowledge proof system is you know   everything lies is true I don't give anything 
um false. I I just make sure everything is true. What I'm saying to you is that um what an 
aura seal really is is um it's two things. It's um it's two things. It's a it's a foreign system 
uh for you can have two to one public keys. Uh and you need that two to one public keys, two to one 
mapping. Uh so you get used to private key uh on your server and you give two public keys. So if 
they try to uh break the public key uh they need to deal with other public key uh fixing the other 
public key because you know you got the other   public key backed up in the system and that will 
be what is used for that system because the public key is public and the public key is uh is for so 
heals the other one you know and the system can continue coherently and you go to private key you 
can store the private key anyhow but they bound   to that private key and this I'm saying to you 
another thing I want to say basically um that's the standard uh classical direct exploitation uh 
you can use that for private keys too Uh but the private key is uh same thing as a public key map 
to your avatar your system you know who you are uh your identity uh based on the uh the avatar 
system your the social media expose but I'm saying to you the the the main thing about the system 
it's a it's a forance uh healing uh based on the   errors 0 to one 1 to 5 11 to 18 plus 5 low medium 
and you can heal systems uh in real time and still get your data you know the the main so for the 
private key you can have two private keys keys, two private keys and one public key. you know it 
doesn't how much it depends depends on how secure   you want your system and what use case you know 
you know you can have this system the DKP systems doesn't need to tell you the public key even you 
know you can store two public keys you know and have them as proofs on a real time system you know 
and when the system times out once you got some um um you can heal the system and continue whatever 
you're doing another thing the latis transform that system is like uh uh the lat system. So 
the quantum implication is based on latis uh deformationation you know uh what I mean by that 
it's like uh the you got latis which is like um uh uh quantum field and you the the zco peep system 
only uh does not um uh it's like you know uh so you have like a latis which is like the world 
around us the environment you got like a quantum   uh latis for radio it's like a money it's only 
visible on the radio you send the message like a Wi-Fi signal whatever like a Bluetooth signal 
and then the the system lic system just decohes because you know once I send that message you 
don't need to keep that channel so it the channel just disappears uh corrupted by other noise so 
basically what you're going to try for a bridge a quantum bridge you know and that's what the latis 
is doing so basically my other my position for   zero core for oral cells it's just based on latice 
deformation you know and uh coherence you know uh it's based on plasma coherence or plasma system so 
the plasma systems are just a system you can keep um you can a bridge that's stable just to do 
what you want you know so for example if I'm sending internet signal uh if I'm sending internet 
signal I just like uh if I want to send someone Wi-Fi someone like a message I create like a like 
some kind of um uh zero um zero knowledge proof system and doesn't I validate of it and that 
person doesn't need to uh check it just send randomly instead of noise and that person oh 
yeah that matches the what I want to get you   that's the metadata And that then open oh yes I 
want this and I want the information you know and that be the protocol of communication because you 
don't need to send all information you just say   okay yep I know it's me I'm talking here uh I send 
information you know and then it's not even about license you know one about license I made but that 
alignment can be used for legacy ones you know things but l you know based on architecture 
like multiple pairs like it works it works uh but that proof is based on the um github that 
comes patterns there's a latis um alignment one so you can either a line of letters or like a like 
you know geomet geometrically uh with the with the program or on the people with the forthright 
peer-to-peer topology such as the peer-to-peer uh Russell or the boss topology which is like a nodes 
on the network people that know but the go to do the latest defformation isn't about really about 
breaking lattice and bringing the world it's about um uh because you know as a speaker this is Uh 
yeah, I can hear noise here. Uh but you know the range money, radio waves, microwave, infrared, 
visible light, uh ultraviolet, x-ray are noise. Yes, but there noise. Yes, but those noise are 
incoherent. The system is not stable. I can I can uh intercept the radio wave. Yes, if I wanted to, 
but I don't have the I can but you know I don't know how to interpret a radio signal to something 
that's coherent because you know that's that's   going through a lot of cores too based on bio bio 
Bluetooth uh bio bin informatics. So information is not enough to decode, you know, I can get 
information. Yes. Uh and relay it to myself,   but but I but I can't really um uh replicate the 
full structure of the information just jargon because I I don't send you everything, you know, 
it's zero knowledge. I don't need to know about   it. Uh if you don't know, but you know, I can't 
decipher everything because it's encrypted here, it's there, and it looks like god jargon because 
it is jargon, you know. because no information   is not there to make it coherent and never become 
the system never never expose that channel to the system. So the thing about this the plasma 
the quantum one is it you don't align the   latises you define something called a latis uh 
latis is a model on complex numbers. So the we go complex under JK that's the complex numbers 
field but the IG brackets uh bracket the bracket notation you know based on uh physics the standard 
applied physics now the bracket notation is like uh can be a bra or a cat and they can be both 
you know they are homogeneous and heterogeneous uh use of the they can be used for alignment 
uh for um for field such as light waves and everything and the thing about that they they 
can shoot can shoot a laser canform formed   into a spectrum of field and because you know if 
if you have white light you can really get all the ways of life from the white light you know 
that's called prism uh but this for defraction   everything so I'm saying to you the the goal of 
the latformation isn't really about the how you see me guys isn't really stop recording webcam uh 
okay so goal of the information isn't really about the uh system it's about like it's basically like 
opening like a secure channel in that space where there's no noise. So you can send the message 
or inversely create a channel where there isn't uh uh you know I can I can make a basically I can 
make a channel open. So so I can send and then that channel like an open space a buffer zone. So 
the buffer zone is like um a platform buffer zone. So I can have a buffer zone in the real world just 
sending uh data stream and the buffer zone will be the bubble waiting for information so I can send 
it and that could be any uh anyone acting and that system will remain coherent because the system is 
waiting for connection any time it doesn't stop it just witnesses the state I'm getting information 
enough to do something you know and then when   the system can then access give you the data you 
know has to be perfectly aligned with the system uh system so the the perfect alignment is based 
on the um or algorithm. So if the system fails, you will know it fails. Oh uh because the oral 
lines of it so this what I'm saying the GCD and LCM is the oral cell. So if these two balanced 
uh DCD which stands for greatest common divider you know and they're balanced then the harmonic 
structure you get an oral shell you know and this   is the algorithm why so you can have like a just 
number system you know but I'm really focused on the classical quantum system because I'm doing 
my masters this is algorithm so gcd1 equals one uh gcd2 equals 2 so basically how you work 
divider is you um you basically you pick like a um you pick a number six uh you then have a 
three uh three over six uh gcd of six will be what uh can track with one gcd of so divided 
by two uh you get uh 2 to three and three is a three is just an odd number but this is not an 
odd perfect number you know it's just a it's not there's a three in there 3 * 1 is three and that's 
not it's not it's not an odd perfect you got two uh this just three and two uh now now now this is 
cgcd now this now the LCM of this um is basically one key sdm and they'll be either heterogeneous 
or homogeneous functions like H will be the when they mix data in that public key that share that 
or to do something like to act on some kind of um shared cluster instance and this one two three 
is the output and the LTM of six local multiple so you have to multiply to get six * 1 is six you 
know basically this an alignment here you The the thing is that um this is alignment. You can use 
six as an even number but you know there's not a perfect number for the uh seven. The sum of 1 2 
3 is seven. Yes. Uh but seven is 1 2 3 4 you get eight. But seven is not proper because you know 
it's imp prime number to use for the poly key and just use that to seal the aura of the uh entropy 
of using basically a permutation. I guess it so basically when something breaks you can permit 
it uh to find a pattern in it. So what you what don't want is to find a pattern in the uh coding 
system you know um so but people are really good at finding patterns as with the more information 
the more use the algorithm and also things get   dated why things get addicted is because you know 
there's a lot of information about it and becomes old you know just naturally you know if I search 
the internet I find information about um uh how to   build a house you know I can how to build the the 
best house in the world the mansion I can I can build a house if I wanted to because I have the 
secrets to build a house you know and that's why   photography informatics you know I can say to you 
that you know the permutation is like uh the LCM can be positioned but you know there's birectional 
link between permutation and combination you know   and that's why they make the fun framework really 
uh useful so uh the the thing is to explore this the GTM LTM alignment with permutation and the 
um um um u permutation and combination as isovic layers that do the same things uh for sale the 
thing about this is the traditional brute force You don't really need brute force when you 
have an algorithm. All you need is strategy   uh and keep learning uh keep gathering information 
on the inside of the system and how it behaves. You know this algorithm is based on entropy among 
search space. So basically I can determine a key point of algorithm uh say like a broken artifact. 
You know this complete ratio of entropy among search space. So basically I can get uh something 
like a component A and that component used for B. Uh component A is like a a game library. uh game 
library game assets uh a this can be uh images uh they can be binary files uh two binary files uh 
uh game uh game pot a bin uh game pot bin you know any game you know in two parts now this component 
is just like the um the graphical this just the um this can be any binary set this could be the setup 
system uh setup system and this game card you get this bin so This bin, this binary fails is prone 
to errors on the internet. This game one game part a doin game part and this okay let's call 
it setup set up the bin setup one bin set this like set two and this will be for game the full 
game. Now this game needs updates updates. So what   you need to do is download it from the internet 
you know you know but this this problem so when it does a new updates you download like um game 
uh game setup 3.part setup 3.bin bin and system 3 which are binary file and these are updates 
files. You know if if if the binary artifact a bin the sub one and sub 2.in is like uh hacked 
or you know leaked or something like that. It's got information about it, you know, and we know 
about the game, you know, then the updates can be   uh done too, you know, and you know, you don't 
even need to download the the full game anymore, you know, because you can get the updates too and 
you can change you can work with the um system to get the game from the server, you know, as a real 
hack, you know, cuz the server updates the system, you know, that's what I'm saying. So let me say 
it to you in the real world we don't want this   kind of problem you know our system people that 
are malicious actually using our service want to sell our system we want to use our system so for 
me I'm writing down here so the 512 algorithm or cell 512 is the going back to this kind of 
problemraphy to push people to address this kind of problem in uh as cryptography uh to push 
neurography still represents to me the beginning of the solving problems that are continuous. Am I 
petitioning to solve a problem in the choreography domain or five basically I go or 512 basically 
we're going to talk about he judges the do not stand as like 513 he is just 513 characters but 
that last character have storing three more bytes it's not really useful because you have to have 
it like based on the system uh coherence like uh for example the system uh 512 is basically got uh 
you got like two bits two bits one or zero you can go two to the power of um 64 is uh will give you 
the full sum. Uh but you know that's why computer you know if you're going on standard that means 
there's something wrong doesn't not mean there's   something wrong but it means there's something 
that may be wrong you know because you know the you're not enforcing the the standard practices in 
solving your problem you're not following your own   procedure you know to solve it and that's why 513 
is wrong because the computer for example I know something so basically the buffer the buffer is 
512 uh I can have 513 but you know if I have a a bit bridge incorrectly I have to make sure that 
that if I then declare the last bit or the last call assigned bits or a hide assigned buffer 
where I give another 16 buffer for 16 bits uh for decimal digest you know then that 16 bits 
for 513 is broken because I the computer can force it you know using a standard computational method 
and can flip the script on it so it has to heal   itself you know can heal itself but 512 is better 
because the system is more coherent to evolve and understand what it's doing now you know so not we 
can use that for the 16 bit 32 bit bas on the oct Bas on the eight oct system also basically uh so 
now basically I basically I download I have not now four I have like one set of artifact the game 
and the game updates game game v1 and game v2 you know these have four two components each you know 
now I can create a a release structure you know something that distribute the or shell so I can 
have like the keys like um hashtag uh 5 a 2b 3 c 1 2 3 4 Five, six. This is just one. This is like 
the first game uh setup setup.bin. Setup one. Bin. And this is like set one by the bin. And this is 
like uh 5 A to unless you just move. So basically when this component uh tries to get it uh set 
one for bin and then set two the bin will be um 5 A 2 B 3 C. That's like just a standard hex 
detect um because there's just a to f and zero to 9 you know in hex decimal. And then in other 
one we have like um two three C 3 E F01 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 see and this to be two to form the two 
efforts. Now two efforts share a function link uh function link between uh GCD and uh LCM for uh 
integrity uh integrity. Now if uh if the gamebin A1 breaks uh the two can recover the artifact and 
stop people actually updating the system you know you know because you know you have to ensure that 
this match this check matches because they work   together. So your goal for this framework is to 
develop me person to an algorithm that recovers birectionally using a direct exactly graph. So 
basically if the first activifier fails it's uh it doesn't really load anything uh because the that 
mean the second active is not complete either you know it's not only one so I can develop basically 
I have to develop a polygon or a sale algorithm   that uh ensures that you know the the the sales 
are basically can be the public al to the web so I can have like a a download hash function uh 
integrity HTML hash function uh that has an oral seal integrity uh and that be oral here um 512 um 
uh but you know 512 is just as default now unless you want uh uh 256 uh so basically um you got 
to understand this is based on 222 so 4id by 2 get 64 this is just low security or 512 which is a 
medium security or 512 or 6 512 which is 256 which is medium and 512 is high the goal of the oral 
shell is to have the seamless integrity between the public keys and the private key structure 
that's serving the function thing. can separate   the fun into the private key uh fully you know the 
function the mapping so you can have the private key to recover the public key and then share that 
and distribute that as even uh even evenly across the space you know uh you understand that you 
don't the goal also is just to ensure that the algorithm remains coherent at all times because 
because you know the entropy distribution of entropy uh the noise is uh is balanced there's no 
entropy in any way shape or form which is a policy uh uh which is uh for me to give to my practice 
in the system of the aura. So the or is it because the if you have a function there's no there's no 
exploit because the or the the or algorithm is like a distributed uh amongst all the charts all 
the analytical frameworks which is not impossible once you have all the ordination distri how the 
calculates integrates with the system you know the especially when you get a user for uh you go to 
focus on your infrastructure and your architecture uh you know what you're building Um the two 
to one mapping includes basically the oneway function is like you know a function that can 
never be revered you know like you know it can be   um it can't be can't be reserved because you get 
one you know but if you get one that's be two you know so basically if something is a perfect uh one 
way function you can never get the output the same apple back you know because there's nothing to get 
you know so I don't believe that this function is   true I only believe that you get something you 
should get something back but because you get noise and that's noise you know you know how 
I make sure that noise is noisy. So noisy no wants to try again, you know. So noisy don't want 
to hack your stuff, you know, because they just   give them give give them give them a hold, you 
know. The the oneway function is there, you know, you can't def develop a oneway function. Yes, but 
the one function would give nothing and that'll give something out. You know, there's something 
there. You know, you want to ensure that you give   nothing, you know, out. So basically think, 
oh, that's just noise. Let me just ignore it. which sounds kind of intuitive because you know if 
you simulate the real world or emulate it you know   you don't really have to show the real world 
you have to be my one function works because you can't have one you can't have one function yes 
something that nothing because you know absolutely but one function is a perfect hash function so the 
perfect hash integrity means that um the function or the fun which maps across all the functions the 
functions uh literally is a hash value so the hash value is like the oneway function And the one way 
is like you know you cannot reverse it. It doesn't   uh you can't hash hash hash hash and reserve it 
like a like a v hashing function. So the hashing function is just at the um hashing function uh 
for each component setup a the setup bin and then when you then upload um setup um setup um three 
setup three set up the setup three function setup three.b set of four for that artifact. you get 
a new uh actually demonstrate like 128654 128540 uh for setup uh 3W uh set of four is F20 012 46 
and there six numbers and this will be another one that related to the one there you know so 
basically whenever the entropy changes you know   when something is changing based on telemetry 
tracking GUI ID you know and see who should exploit the system now the GUID for global unique 
identifier ID and unique identif the the tracking of the states for that artifact. You know someone 
try to run a program on an exe file to de assemble it. You know those kind of things uh what you 
are trying to really mitigate with an oral shell. You know you have to show that uh any action has 
an equal force for every force you have there's an equal and opposite force you know because you 
know if someone tries to um uh uh next basically um it's basically my my thing you know hacking 
with a program they are really disassembling the program you know with a disassembler which is and 
they bypass the find patterns in the data or find some insights in the program based on what you 
did you know you all go to fix that snap snap   to think about the the system. So you have to have 
understand that net force equals z when something is stable once equil equilibrium you know the 
system is continuous the work continuous everyone can get a job everyone authentic can get a job and 
then the second one is force equals massation the force acting on an object the amount of hacks 
the mass basically equals to the mass the size   of the force the magnitude times the acceleration 
the speed of the force the speed of the force is like how much the force is actually you know based 
on what's observing you know how damage. You know,   it reminds me of the hacker's journal. You know, 
it's about like uh ensuring that uh bad actors are are kept at bay, you know, and wondering what they 
do next. You know, they don't know what they're   going to try to do next. They don't give them any 
insight. You know, there's no force to give them, you know, you know, they don't because you state 
of the command for that digest. And the next last one is force because uh for every negative force 
there's a equal and positive force you know you   can act can can seize assets you know you can 
enforce lawsuits you know and that's what the oral sale means me you know the 256 context aware 
it knows what he's doing you know it's like you know if you have a license if you have like my us 
respected license and I'm doing business you know   this one business it's conscious it knows what 
he's doing it's observing and witnessing you know the licensing revoking sampling software 
gaming assets secure downloads you know conclusion so this is about this uh by viewing 
the problem as lines you get location up number uh perfect number so the goal of this is to 
have a system that's coherent and doesn't   um it doesn't it just rem you know it responds 
to real threats real world threats you know other than brute force you know it's basically you got 
one of the last but you know doesn't think about instrument to demonstrate to visualize visualize 
visualize the algorithm it's conting basically contpation like you know my new I can like um by 
uh by day by day every day by daily every two day uh uh by day like every day I do one thing two 
every day I take a shower every two day I take a morning shower or one to two every one day 
you know that's interpretation it's context It's a way of the so in two interpretation based 
on new diver featured two to one one to two to one you know and that's how the ter works this real 
world you know we don't form a reg structure to   be the other thing you know and I'm saying it's 
like um it's like a two to two to two everything two to one two to one everything you know that's 
the goal you know as a policy I want to enforce   you know to be able to gen you know not just one 
thing we think it is you know based on what we try two interpretations of that thing one thing 
if I get it wrong which we don't get wrong you know and that's what an aura is the aura of 
the algorithm has been sealed okay guys I hope this is right okay guys have a lovely day uh and 
guys I hope you do s your or solve your problem this is insignia this is 7day deadline have a 
lovely day and uh uh uh go to youtube.com/obex give it a like go to github.com/obi nexus 512 
uh which is just a polyot zero core interface uh for latis rotation. The goal is to rotate 
latis and enforce the dimensional game theory um obx's github.com/obx dgt uh resolution uh for 
NFA. So you can have a nonics it can be two things but you know two things causing a problem two two 
things you know either starting for you know and that's the we don't look at something to a rigid 
framework we we give we try to interpret uh like human beings not just like code through var 
gating principles okay thank you stop recording
