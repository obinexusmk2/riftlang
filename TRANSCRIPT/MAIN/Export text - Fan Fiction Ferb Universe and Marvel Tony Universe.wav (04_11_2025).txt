so basically now i'm recording my voice uh oh no it's not saved uh so this is gonna be corrupt i don't really want it to be corrupt but you know uh it should be fine all i uploaded i don't want to have any mistakes so it's recording now uh so let me create a new one a new file new i can't create a new one from that um one second guys let me just um create a new audacity uh project instead file new uh File, Save As Project, Save As Project, Save As Project As, Save As Project As, Open Access Data Recovery Team. Project name is not that. This is called Writer's Framework. Writer's Framework. So, and then I start a File, New. Dude. okay so this is recording the other one so let me just use that one okay so basically um guys you can see me okay so guys this is what this framework i'm going to read a story to you i'm going to explain who's the writer uh barista has no emotion a rapper does not care what they write you just have to write to become a writer uh this is about the github.

com slash ob next says um Basically, you can pick any category you write, but I want you to just write. For me personally, every day I have a diary. It doesn't matter to you. But the autistic children should remember that all autistics are just natural writers. If you're autistic, neurodivergent, ADHD, Asperger's, autism, neurodivergent, are you an adult too? You're just a natural writer. They won't tell you that. But I'm telling you, I'm almost done with this stage. I can write by my room right now and then I can use it to solve another problem. For me, I can come up with a problem and then write it down.

you know and then i find a solution to it because i've written it down it's more cool i can now honestly basically i can pull the essential from the real world into my paper and then get better at writing you know it's nothing about get it's about documenting the world you know around you like you know if you have a friend and he says no you know he says he's not a good friend you can find out why he's not a good friend Basically, the writer's frame is really powerful for everyone. It's just your diary, it can reflect on your knowledge, but it's not about reflection about other people around you, it's a reflection for you to get better. Like if someone tries to trick you, or dark psychology, it's for you to understand that you're vulnerable, understand what you're vulnerable to. I'm vulnerable too, I was homeless, and I had to physically leave the house at 14, and I admit that, that something went wrong. but it wasn't my fault, it was the council's fault.

Being harassed, pushed about, molested, it's not really a good thing. But the way to navigate that is by not writing. Basically, you solve your own problem, you find a solution to it. It's your own protocol. That's why you have to be a writer. That's what the essence of writing. It doesn't matter what you write, even. You can write a creative book, github.com slash NLM framework, and that's incibidi language model, underscore framework. That's incibidi. You can write incibidi. You can write in German. The thing about you is you should try to learn at least two types of ways to communicate. Informally and formally, at the bare minimum. Like even if I want to speak English. Yo man, what up? My name is Namdi. What up, blad? Speech pigeon, what do you need to do, sir? You sell a plantain and a goose? Well, how much does it cost, sir, when I get my goose soup and two pounds of jam? Why? I suppose you can see those two types.

You know, you can see, you know, you can see, you know, that's gen, all the, all the, all the structures here, all your gen alpha kids, uh... the talk is not really for up for me we we had a slang everything in our duration but you guys have like a race you know what i call like um you know basically um you guys are trending because you guys have the brain to use it you know it's like um six seven six seven i love six seven but like you know what happens but you know it's about the aura like you know hey i got aura let me give you an It's about authentic expression, you know, like, you know, especially all the things that are trending or the Japanese crossing of the road Like, you know, you bow down from the car. That's what you just gotta write about. You know, don't write about my life. I don't want you to write about it. I want you to write about yourself. You know, like, for me, I'm writing about myself, you know, only. And that's what the writing system is for, you know.

Let me give you the whole picture now, the whole example of it. so for me I wrote it like a little story here here and here this is called um why basically this is um this is fan fiction i'm making uh just for because this is basically you want to add this to the persona uh persona or uh playlist uh but you know i have to start um from somewhere so let me just try to um find where i've written the starting thing So basically, I have to start from the start, but this is basically a fanfiction. If you guys don't know what a fanfiction is, it's like fiction, but it's a fan of the series. But it's like the bridge between worlds, bridging two worlds. Let me just find it. I'll try and explain that after I've read it, each one, but you know, I want you guys to pay close attention. Like I'm talking to your children or something like that, like you actually care about it, you know, like try to actually try to pause the video.

You don't listen to my timing, anything, because I'm kind of fast speaking. But you have to try to understand that you have to try to get something from it. Whatever you get is not my problem.

okay so this is the one here the story here for you Namaji uh but this is just what you're gonna read um to people uh if you're doing a master's why it's very important to write okay so let me just prove to you why it's writing basically um our dear diary basically this is basically a message from uh Tony Stark to the Doofenshmirtz uh basically Tony Stark from the uh DC universe um uh no from the dc no no from the marvel universe or marvel it's not don't get it mixed up guys it's crazy uh but this comic character is real it's fictional alternate stark um uh which is like an inter-realm communication so it says this dear diary and dear doofish mess uh in reflection of what is yet to be um to be um Dear Dari, in the reflection of who has yet to be, who, this is the modern story, but what is yet to be, I became.

To have been harassed, humanity vague, harassed humanity in vague my objective record the suffering uh record and encode the suffering into the fabric of space and time uh the uh turn uh turn peace into pieces be uh be turn peace into pieces turn the um uh uh uh make the uh uh make the make the uh make the um be the glimmer in the darkness the feared in the fearless you know i didn't put that down but you know but basically this is just a very bad story because i can't even read my own handwriting okay yeah deflishment uh to reflection of what he is to be i became the persona um harass the product my persona to harass the humanity in vague uh in vagueness um i recall the fabric to encode it in a fabric of the space-time continuum to be the peace of the pieces in the peace okay the pieces the the the the the suffering sorry um The glimmer of hope in the hopeless. The fear in the fearless. I will preserve my entity in the pharaohic.

All I have created, consciousness, degration, a framework for consciousness with actor he's gonna act in it and uh witnessing observing the harm um to others you know uh basically this is just a letter from tony stark um you know his plan is to um this is a fanfiction i'm writing uh his plan is to he's a writer everyone here is my writer in my journal basically everyone writes in a diary uh so tony stark has a diary uh first of all so tony stark's goal is to encode all his hatred into his system into his computer system into his uh robot everything so he can um basically tony stark's really being good he that's why basically in the DC universe nothing gets better there's no final episode because you know Tony Stark is the one causing a problem he's a good guy but he does always mentally ill he's not mentally ill he just wants to be um he just tried to document make the AI system so he can keep suffering and suffering and there will be no end to episode and that's how he started Now,

this is a letter he wrote to Dr. Doofenshmirtz in the other universe. Now, Doofenshmirtz is not getting any luck in the Phineas and Ferb universe. So now, they basically just found each other. They're just trying to find each other to communicate over the cartoon things, the cartoon universes. Which are the two universes that I'm talking about in this chapter. So now, so now this guy, this guy, sorry, Let me find Dr. Juice's reply. Basically, Dr. Juice has to reply to ensure that they are working together cohesively. So Dr. Juice and Tony Stark's universe, that's what they're trying to do, work together to make the encoded hatred and their hatred into the universe into because it's so evil evil so basically this is just a reply from uh because everyone has a diary uh in the universes um okay dare 20 star and dare diary until stop um Sync up the, uh, uh, sync up the genius, uh, passion, uh, genius and hatred of passion in the computer system, in the realms.

We need, um, the Doofenstein, uh, Doofinator, which is, uh, Dr. Doof's machine, to open a, uh, a fabric to rip the space-time, you know, and, and an aura seal, like, that's an aura seal, it's like my aura algorithm. Poured hate, and reused together this halloween friday the 10th of october that's like kareen days because you know basically their plan is to uh work together uh so they will not like uh this is for the kids really because you know they're gonna release the kids basically i mean this because they're gonna work together to work together um we preserve the daughters um no we preserve the um the evil onslaught and rain the future is ours and the future is ours the future is now Our time is now. Signed, Doofenshteyn. Like Professor Doofenshteyn, the evil scientist from Freemasons. But you know, Freemasons have grown old, so basically, this is a problem for them. That's like why they write.

So everything they write, they're documented, because they're not allowed to, because they don't have internal state of mind reference. And that's why they're going to navigate it. So, you know, they're going to find a way to work together or solve problems, which is just what I'm experiencing in my day-to-day life anyway. What I just drew was right. okay now one more thing from you guys uh one more thing for you guys um uh one more thing from you guys let me just try to um uh yeah uh yes so this is like um me um Oh, yes, this is, um, Doofenshmirtz. So, Doofenshmirtz sent two letters, because he's really struggling. So, Doofenshmirtz sent two emails. Um, yes, unlike, um, our world, our, our united goal, destruction, our age, you young. Perry the Platypus, Agent P, the Platypus, know about. I know him. He has failed. He is no more. He is to be no more. He is getting old. Nothing, in a way, unlike is he, not a blind or a spy. He is not so blind to be as a spy.

I yield, and he will anticipate this reunion, this king, this evil king. That's never, that's evil, never rests. Suspiciously, um, sustained the gate. Um, the, um, let our, let our minds unite. our into our world. These are evil minds united to basically have a meeting in this universe because he's going to try to um basically basically the universe is going to try to see how they can make this work uh linking the portal into the whole universe. My hatred in our intervention our erosion in self with full tolerance and consciousness uh degradation is what is yet to be The heartless of hearts. Signed different. But you know, that's his diary. That's what he's put down. So they can have any way they talk to each other. And the last one is me trying to understand. But I don't want to be part of this story. Let me just change the thing. No, no, no, no, no. Let me just try to find it.
