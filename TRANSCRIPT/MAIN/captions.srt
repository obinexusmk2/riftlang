S uh X I A on space regret devil's deal.

89
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,440
Uh this is very important for me. This

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,519
like uh the story about Zia a devil

91
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,560
worshipper. She has everything but she

92
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,400
wants more power. She wants um uh

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
universal power. She wants to able to

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,959
like go into the demon realm and do

95
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,799
stuff to the demons. But you know she

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
starts to power and her dad mama king.

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,439
They're monarchs. Uh they're Chinese um

98
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,879
and Japanese. uh but not Chinese because

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
that's Chinese history. So you know

100
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,880
Japanese and they want um Jia is very

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
rich but she's very agreed with power.

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
She wants to be the the most powerful

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,240
person in the world because you don't

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,639
think mom and dad are doing well with

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,199
the power making everything normal good

106
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,280
for everyone just she's evil basically I

107
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,919
love basically I love evil evil stuff.

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,400
Uh this one is um uh this is incibility.

109
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,320
So basically this for like um the I

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
still got it inspired by the people. So

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
basically this means king and this goes

112
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,800
down. See this king uh that's king. The

113
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,199
cross is like the um uh king or child to

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
become a king. Child adult in king. So

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
this like see this one. So basically

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,520
this means child to adult to king cuz

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm a n king cuz my dad want to crown

118
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
me. But I'm a real king for real guys.

119
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm not joking to you. Just my dad is

120
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,600
useless. Um um so this is the one. Uh so

121
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
this is like a proep here. This is a

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
king. But it's like a pattern for it. So

123
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
this one's king. This one's going back

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,560
to the country. this like a sibly um so

125
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,759
this about like iconography but about

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,600
the really icons but all are symbols but

127
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
symbols are just etchings so there's a

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
relationship you know so like I can just

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,600
draw a symbol um but a symbol won't mean

130
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,639
anything it's just an etch I can just

131
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
draw but you the go giving me making me

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,240
something so referral system matching

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,639
time uh then we got um this uh thing

134
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
here

135
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,520
oh basically I wanted wings so I myself

136
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,360
wings

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,759
So this wing basically but this like one

138
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,759
wing type it's like if I spread it out

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,880
but this is for like actually um this is

140
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,960
called um this was actually for

141
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
something called um another basically

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
this art was called um what's the

143
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,800
article piece called

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,639
uh this RP was called um wingman. So

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
basically you see this wing this wing is

146
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,520
like a resition of like someone that's

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:02,240
really OP uh you know in in CQB uh close

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
quarters combat. So see if you know CQB

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
you know there's a song called a wingman

150
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,919
and that person also

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,520
uh the corner so it's like corner slicer

152
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,080
but you know that person has a very

153
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,520
important job and that's to kill um uh

154
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,080
your eye to side cuz we can turn 180 180

155
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,319
but that's not enough uh when you are in

156
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,400
close combat it's like it's narrow it's

157
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
like it's too much to do it's like you

158
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,000
know and the wingman is just um your

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,319
field of view over uh 180° uh but you

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
know you are basically looking straight

161
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,039
you

162
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,720
uh not straight, but you're looking like

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,720
in between 180 uh 90° um uh but you

164
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,440
don't really cover the whole um uh let's

165
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,039
say 125 uh 90 to 125 degrees, but you

166
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
don't cover everything cuz you don't. So

167
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,800
the wingman cover the rest cuz you know

168
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,800
they'll get a gun and they go by your

169
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,800
side and it's like a tag team. So

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
basically they they clear out the the

171
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
hard corners like you know uh for

172
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,080
example this is a basically say someone

173
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,160
um in that like say this like this is a

174
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,840
corner here. This is corner here. Let me

175
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,840
just show you guys. See this corner. So

176
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,880
there's four walls here. Uh one corner

177
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,720
here, one corner here. My bed is another

178
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,280
corner here. See that corner? Uh four

179
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,479
walls, you know. Uh now one left and so

180
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,360
basically uh if I want to go from here

181
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,720
um I position what I mean uh into that

182
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,400
door uh into that door there uh uh this

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,759
corner. I cut this I go to this corner

184
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,000
here. This corner here uh and then I say

185
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,479
okay now I slice. Now this is now this

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,800
person is like uh uh that corner there

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,639
is like the entrance like the is like

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,639
someone going in. So basically cuz I'm

189
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
going out I want to go out. I I then

190
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,800
turn and shoot. Um but the wingman's job

191
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
is to make sure that all my other angles

192
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,319
are covered you know cuz I can shoot

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,280
there and he can shoot me and I die. But

194
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,440
the wingman can like um pick this corner

195
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,199
here. So I don't have to I keep going

196
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,639
straight. You know it's kind of weird

197
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,400
but you know I just keep going where I

198
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,240
want to go. That's called a point man.

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,039
So you got a wingman and a point man. Uh

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,680
this like a wing wingman. Uh the winged

201
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,120
man. The wingman. Uh the wingman is a

202
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,560
drawing. Uh and this like a a giraffe.

203
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
This is draft. I don't know what I call

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,080
this like a a bird. No, no. This called

205
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,879
a freedom bird. Draft one. I call it

206
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,280
freedom board. Uh this is a freedom bird

207
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,440
one.

208
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,599
Uh,

209
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
and this is like uh the wing. I need a

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,199
wing uh span. Like you know, I'm

211
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,479
actually trying to lift the wing.

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,919
Basically, it's like a wing or trying to

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,039
lift it. It's like I'm lifting the wing.

214
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,880
You see this? What I should be doing?

215
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,240
Like I should be lifting the wig. Uh

216
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,880
this like um some lady some man lady.

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
It's not me. This is a very dood. But um

218
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,279
I'm going to get back to it. One second.

219
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,560
One second. Let me just come back to it

220
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,080
right now. Uh before I just make a video

221
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,959
now. I'll make a video later about this

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,320
artwork. But uh and this is Ezami. This

223
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,320
is King Nambi because this like I'm a

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,760
king in Nigeria. This is an avatar of my

225
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,920
I'm trying to make uh for my YouTube

226
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,160
channel. Uh but you know the avatar is

227
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,040
going to be there forever. Basically

228
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,519
Nambi is gonna be talking to Ezi Nambi.

229
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,000
So basically this is Nambdi. No this

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,160
Nambdi meaning king in my country. So

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
he's a king. He's wearing an EO crown

232
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,080
almost everything. Uh and then this is

233
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,720
um

234
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,760
so basically you see this this is

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,680
greatness in the making. This is my

236
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,839
glasses everything. Uh he's smart

237
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,839
everything. No, no, sorry. This is a No,

238
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
no. This is king. See the crown? That's

239
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,800
a crown and that's a feather. It's like

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,120
a basically it's a symbolic meaning. You

241
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,080
got a three feathers. Basically, a chief

242
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,240
has two feathers. He has three feathers

243
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,680
for uch e and me obi. So, it's kind of

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
like that. You got an e crown, got the

245
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,920
glasses, and you got the hair, you got a

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,000
beard. Uh this is called a sketch. Uh

247
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,000
let me just show you this. Uh

248
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,600
let's just brighten. Uh okay. So that's

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
like a king. So you can go through it

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,880
again myself. I go to you guys. So I do

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,200
it to myself. So basically um and this

252
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,880
my uh can board uh that's not double

253
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,920
track the other one for the other but

254
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
this is Uber's data uh oriented pattern

255
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,720
uh applications. This was one I make in

256
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,279
a long time. Uh but you know it's like

257
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,680
uh I'm just show you guys actually did

258
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,000
it. You know it's it's meant to be.

259
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
Okay. Then now this is the freedom bird

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,079
here.

261
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,079
Um demon

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,240
basically this is a freedom bird. It

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,800
flies free. It's called a freedom bird.

264
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,320
You never see it. Never fly. It's like

265
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,079
you never see it fly cuz the head is so

266
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
m shaped. It's like I'm looking at you

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,560
but it's weird. You know it's a freedom

268
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,399
bird. It's like a very It's like a

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000
freedom. See the winker in is perfect. I

270
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,519
got it perfectly right. It's flying

271
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,320
perfectly but the head is kind of funny.

272
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,680
It's a bird. Well, it won't be funny.

273
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,040
Uh, but that's what I'm saying to you

274
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
guys. So, basically guys, I'm showing

275
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,959
you guys I made this IP work. Uh, so you

276
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,480
guys can look. Oh, you can't draw

277
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,640
nothing. I don't care what you say and

278
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
draw, right? Just draw. Uh, okay. So,

279
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,560
guys, um, it's for me to just uh reflect

280
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,839
on myself, not you. That's my YouTube

281
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,079
channel. It's just my my inner

282
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,079
monologue, my thoughts. Okay. So, Nami,

283
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,279
why you showing yourself this? So,

284
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,440
basically, so Nami, so basically Nami,

285
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,279
uh, so basically this is the this for

286
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,600
the organism. just going to be clear

287
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,440
this is the um first of all this is a uh

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
for the writer's framework uh keep

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
saying writer's framework but you know

290
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
the writer's framework is this anyway so

291
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,839
basically got a doodle uh which is just

292
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
a do question that doesn't mean anything

293
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,680
basically got level zero this is level

294
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,600
zero this a child's drawing uh you got

295
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,440
this catch uh this sketching like level

296
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,839
one like the sketch you know the the

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
form uh you given to some object form

298
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,399
you know and you got the authentic

299
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,440
pressure like um is he me is he no he

300
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,120
got the no I got I expression. Okay.

301
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
Basically, you got the authentic

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,880
expression. Yeah. So, this level two

303
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
like authentic expression in the in the

304
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,200
biome where you are like who you are,

305
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,399
what you expressing. Uh this uh this

306
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,920
like uh symbol like then you got um

307
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
basically you got level zero which is a

308
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,279
do you can do anything. Level two one is

309
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,519
catch. Uh level two is what authentic

310
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,440
expression want to express like um like

311
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,760
someone falling, someone dying, sanders

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
emotion. Uh mine was based on verb noun

313
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,600
verb noun pairs like you know uh the

314
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,160
verb noun concept modeling that uh puts

315
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,600
into the uh 3x3 um like you know uh uh

316
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
like the golden ratio proportions

317
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,680
everything how how that depicts the what

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
the emotion I want to give what I want

319
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,279
to show to people about uh whatever I'm

320
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,600
depicting

321
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,079
uh then you got uh authentic uh

322
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
craftsmanship soaric or cultural

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
expression so it doesn't have to be

324
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,079
cultural can be symbolic can mean to you

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
mean to you and you got um authentic

326
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,399
craftsmanship

327
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,639
uh authentic craftsmanship. So so

328
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
authentic craft on level one. So goes

329
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,079
the pyramid gets harder and harder if

330
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:50,480
climb the pyramid level one uh doodle uh

331
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,680
level zero doo level one's catch level

332
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,240
two uh level three uh level four is a

333
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,839
question uh the craft. So basically I

334
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,079
can take that idea everything and make

335
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
it like a 3D game. or make it like a 3D

336
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,160
model you know uh for example the

337
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
freedom bird I can take it out and make

338
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
it a freedom bird in the world give some

339
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
meaning you know make it like a product

340
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,839
or something like that that's what level

341
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,320
four is authenticationship and you got

342
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
um sovereign car like sovereign means

343
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,519
like the soul or the biome it fits into

344
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,600
the ecosystem like has a theme ecosystem

345
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,240
so sovereign like sovereignty it belongs

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,000
there it's not an ar it's bas basically

347
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
it's based on the world like you know we

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
humans live in earth but it's like a roy

349
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,880
is like in world is is weird but you

350
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,200
know if I'm a human in royald

351
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
world um if a human royal is normal

352
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
because there's the story align with

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
everything so this has the sovereign

354
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
with sovereignty and that's what makes

355
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,600
it um the heart and the soul philosophy

356
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,480
the soul the soul heart obi heart or

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,079
soul this is one two zero one two three

358
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,320
four five for five and five is mentor

359
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,560
six is mentor so mentor can teach anyone

360
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,880
can teach everyone about sovereignty

361
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,920
uh about your origin, my BF history, my

362
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,160
BF history, um like who I am, how how I

363
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,440
treat people. And then you got um

364
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,160
symbolic activist uh uh symbolic

365
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,360
activist. It's like activist symbolic um

366
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,360
like oh so basically

367
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,920
so basically level one 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,839
level seven is a sovereign like

369
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,440
sovereign states. You b that biome. part

370
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
of that t that makes you buy a part

371
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
where you live it's sovereign that's the

372
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,720
art that belongs there that's a culture

373
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
that's the meaning of symbols and then

374
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
you got the sovereign symbolic activist

375
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,480
you got the um basically level eight is

376
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
symbolic it means something you know you

377
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,000
know symbolic uh it's universal uh it

378
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,199
belongs to everyone anyone can notify it

379
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,880
it's symbolic um but it's symbolic can

380
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,279
activate

381
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm trying to uh create new knowledge of

382
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:58,160
art and culture I'm trying to create new

383
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,399
symbols uh like that me origin

384
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
my own business and thing and symbolic

385
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
um sovereign activist like the

386
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,519
sovereignty of it is it so basically

387
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,839
again this is part of the writer

388
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,079
framework it's called basically the

389
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
right framework um really about this you

390
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,600
got the sovereign activist like being

391
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,399
sovereign to yourself who you are

392
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
basically for me um uh see all this

393
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,279
clothes I'm wearing it's all boring it

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
doesn't mean anything to it's just like

395
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,279
plain there's no innovation uh my

396
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,560
personas it doesn't maintain it doesn't

397
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,560
mean anything it's just like charity

398
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,040
close it doesn't mean anything. So this

399
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,399
is just um your framework uh which is

400
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,320
also part of writing. This is like your

401
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,680
creative writing framework. It's like a

402
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,480
uh how you uh um try to inci um and

403
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,639
incidi language model uh which is like

404
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,720
um the the framework behind the writing

405
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,800
uh but it's like for drawing uh mainly

406
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,279
for drawing this just part one for you

407
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,680
but your goal is to have this um pyramid

408
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,000
uh uh universal to the ordinary product

409
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,160
so we can have authentic clothes

410
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,040
authentic garments authentic wear you

411
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,519
know uh for it so it can use to draw

412
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,519
it's called drawic uh because anyone

413
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,279
that draws is called the Anyone that

414
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,120
draws is a drawer. Anyone that writes is

415
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,759
a writer. But what makes make them a

416
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,120
writer? A writer is a drawer. Basically,

417
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,720
you cannot I'm saying that it's part of

418
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,240
writing because you cannot draw without

419
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
writing for me because you know you have

420
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,120
to plan your writing because you plan

421
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,800
you still write on paper and this. So

422
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,959
basically the drawing framework is like

423
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,040
literally drawing and writing. So this

424
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,160
is part of the writing part called

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,360
framework or the artist framework. Um

426
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,120
the goal is to have this universal. Uh

427
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,600
so this is like uh the the thing I'm

428
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,800
creating for the uh authentic uh

429
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,560
conscious mitigation conscious

430
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,720
integration mitigation like you know uh

431
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,680
being sovereign being part of a

432
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,440
community being part of something uh

433
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,759
authentic arts that last and last and

434
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,839
last things that mean something symbolic

435
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,000
things uh that mean something uh uh

436
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,480
basically um basically I'm going to try

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,240
video on the draws from it but this one

438
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm saying to you it's it's authentic

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,920
it's it's you soul Uh I use a lot for a

440
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
lot of uh writing to do it. Um because

441
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,759
I'm a writer too and a drawer. I don't

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,039
care what I draw or the picture. It's

443
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,679
just uh beautiful um to me. Uh but you

444
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,959
know the goal here is to show um this

445
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,319
just like someone looking up in the sky

446
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:18,199
like a robot. But that's me.

447
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,199
Uh yep. Uh

448
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,240
uh it's about uh sovereignty. It's like

449
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
uh who you are. But this is basically um

450
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,319
one more thing Nambdi to tell them to

451
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,559
tell your people. So basically since

452
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,880
this is this is hella complicated uh but

453
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,840
this is basically you see this one here

454
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
or this art here uh anyone in OB anyone

455
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
working with your framework must

456
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,039
understand uh this is basically this

457
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,360
this is uh level zero automatically it's

458
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,559
just a doodle why why is a doodle it

459
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,400
can't be uh it can't be a sketch

460
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
it can't be a sketch uh because it

461
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,919
doesn't mean so the metric how you mark

462
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,679
this so because freedom bird the flying

463
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
birds with a wing uh the wing is looking

464
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,440
up uh tries to look up right right you

465
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,679
know it's flying above is basically it's

466
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,919
like a looking up at a bird and has

467
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,840
wings. Uh this is basically saying that

468
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
the do it's a dudo. Yes. Why? Because

469
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,320
everything's at level zero. If you if

470
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,000
you think you're level two, uh you know,

471
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
basically this is not expression on my

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,760
soul. It's it's a freedom. Yes, I see a

473
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,360
freedom. But the freedom word freedom

474
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,240
doesn't mean anything if I don't have

475
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,280
the um other one the art like the like

476
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,039
the meaning like the like the what I

477
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,600
call the um po one. Basically, if I have

478
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,440
a poem with this as well. So, this this

479
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,000
bird freedom bird has a poem. So, I can

480
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
make a poem right now. Like the bird was

481
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,480
free. It flew over. It never understood

482
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
anything but freedom and freedom was his

483
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,120
name. Uh that poem alone just gives you

484
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,120
like uh the freedom bird, you know, but

485
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,919
that people will not know it's a freedom

486
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,840
bird. So, basically your goal is to um

487
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,440
take uh let me try to write the phone

488
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,280
properly. Uh let me just stop this

489
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,280
video. Basically your goal is to So

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,880
guys, anyone working with my framework

491
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:02,559
um level 0 to uh nine

492
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:07,120
uh the freedom free free was the bird

493
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:11,840

494
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:15,039
wishes uh wishes which

495
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,200
uh free will the bird

496
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,000
flock

497
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,000
flocking Three

498
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
block

499
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,039
guys to make a poem right now to see how

500
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
this works. So basically guys, I'm

501
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,679
making a poem right now. So I want you

502
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,440
guys to bear with me. So basically go to

503
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,640
Freedom Bird everything. Uh this is

504
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,919
called the Freedom Bird. um uh emotion

505
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,559
uh basically this is something called

506
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:56,880
emotion pivots and crisis. So emotion um

507
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,280
emotion means like uh a motive um uh you

508
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,000
know basically the emotion crisis for is

509
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,600
like um it's like um if you go to my

510
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
medium post I'm going to try to use it

511
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,760
but you know uh let me try to find it

512
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,280
actually guys um so basically I I'm just

513
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,320
using my explicit I'm trying to kind of

514
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
find it like um here oh no you know it's

515
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
like a

516
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,280
so basically this should be like um you

517
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,120
know it's like you know locked somewhere

518
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,360
It should be locked in now.

519
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,679
Uh

520
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,679
so basically

521
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,039
so basically this is my uh medium. Uh

522
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,440
I'm looking for something called um uh

523
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,000
crisis uh purpose and emotion. I should

524
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,520
be here in my uh repository. I didn't

525
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,840
plan this is like the other ones. The

526
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,919
other one uh crisis um

527
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,720
uh so basically oh it's called Z

528
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,400
regrets. Uh so yes this is zest regret

529
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,080
please look at this but this is what the

530
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,159
the thing is. So you got like the BFR

531
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,480
pattern, the P one uh the private key

532
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
here. See this private key? That's the B

533
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,840
pattern. The P one, the public key and

534
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,679
the avatar uh the basically you got the

535
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,280
uh uh P the public key and art protocol.

536
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,799
But this is like um a pattern because

537
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,799
you know the B pattern is like B of

538
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,559
butterfields the private key you got the

539
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
P which is art protocol and the fracture

540
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
but you don't want to about this. This

541
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,880
is where the art really is you know and

542
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,720
then you can use it for something else

543
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,520
if it works in the real world um which

544
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,799
is how it is. So basically see Z regrets

545
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,200
um before you go um this is just like uh

546
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,280
the crisis um see this one. So basically

547
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,240
I'm trying to create one for the um show

548
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,799
don't tell. So this is a poem uh poem is

549
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,880
like um a poem a pro is not a poem

550
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,039
because I'm saying to you I can be

551
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
poetic but a pros is like me saying to

552
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,840
someone else I can sing to someone else.

553
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,320
This a pros. So basically I can say sing

554
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,840
about Juliet my wish for Juliet but if

555
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,960
it's about Juliet um where you know even

556
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,799
one sent one word of Juliet Romeo and

557
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,559
Juliet you will learn my lover that's a

558
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,679
pros because it's not it's not a poem

559
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,360
because you're not singing about

560
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,520
yourself. You can say I'm falling in

561
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,880
love with a beautiful woman but you

562
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,360
cannot say Juliet or like um her name

563
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,120
because that says she's an example. Uh I

564
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,320
love her but you can say I love women

565
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,679
but you don't understand why you love

566
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,480
women. So the difference between a poem

567
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,880
and a pros first of all is because the

568
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,520
poem is only you you you me myself and

569
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,280
I. You speak about your feelings who you

570
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,679
are but pro you speak about your love

571
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,120
your interest what you do um that's your

572
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,640
bas like a show don't tell. So basically

573
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,480
show don't tell you show the audience

574
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,679
this like part of the motion. So

575
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,480
basically character crisis relationship

576
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,400
uh internal conflict stakes uh in

577
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
certain incidents settings and um

578
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,799
setting. So basically this is just a uh

579
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
this is this model is a crisis pivots.

580
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,679
Um basically this is crisis that

581
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,520
happened in a story for example uh why

582
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,840
is there a freedom bird? Why is why does

583
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,799
a bird fly? What's the crisis? Why is it

584
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,200
free flock [ __ ] free? Why does want to

585
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,480
be part of a flock? You know what what's

586
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,559
the significance of having a freedom

587
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
bird? That's the crisis. But you know

588
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,480
it's based on trilogy. So the model of

589
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,880
this is like um really um uh like you

590
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,280
know you got like a forest but a forest

591
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,880
alternative is like uh creative um

592
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,720
formally. So alliteration uh uh fact uh

593
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,799
alliteration

594
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:28,799
uh uh alliteration uh facts and figures

595
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:33,919
uh uh onia wait

596
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:35,840
uh uh questions uh a motive language

597
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,200
uh basically this one's like um long

598
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,200
simile and met of and rule of threads

599
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,679
you know this like um for like non

600
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,200
creative writing like formal writing use

601
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,280
to um write to uh formal bodies uh but

602
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
is like a for techniques the techniques

603
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,840
cuz they're not using the same

604
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,520
specification but you know it's for

605
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,679
creative writing so this what I'm doing

606
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,200
for my uh English basically this right

607
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,559
is why it's part of right so good cuz

608
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,679
you know let me explain now so you got

609
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,960
the crisis uh crisis is like um

610
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,080
character your character is the heart of

611
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,159
a story reader must care about them uh

612
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,240
at root of them but never fear them so

613
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,640
basically the goal is this is like you

614
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,760
continue so you for everything you

615
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,240
create the freedom bird you create

616
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
uh you must care for them focus on each

617
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
character depth uh the quirks and

618
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,400
motivation uh for example my freedom

619
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,400
bird who is my freedom bird uh basically

620
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,320
the character must be like um itself you

621
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,679
know like I fly I can't say basically

622
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,200
instead of me saying um um so this how

623
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,760
you use the framework properly so

624
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,679
basically I got to do properly so I am I

625
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,159
am free I am free flock so there's a

626
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,400
bird speaking and that's a po one I am

627
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,159
free of flock

628
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm free of the flock. Free.

629
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,880
I am free of the flock. You know, free

630
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,880
bird, freedom bird

631
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,320
in my kingdom. In my king

632
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,679
with my

633
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,760
shoulder.

634
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,799
Okay. Basically with my wisdom with my

635
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,600
wisdom

636
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,600
I I build

637
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,520
I am my own kingdom.

638
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,039
Basically the kingdom is like the birds

639
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,200
fly around. Basically it flies itself.

640
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,640
It's free. It's it's it own you know

641
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,919
that's example I'm giving you guys. So

642
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
it's a freedom bird. I'm calling it a

643
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,640
freedom bird. But the idea of this is

644
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,799
for you to understand this framework. Um

645
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,640
so this is like the writing here. I am

646
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,320
free um um uh basically if you try to

647
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
put this narrative chip in here. So

648
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,960
basically you just try to do it now. Oh

649
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,000
my battery my battery is going to die.

650
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,120
My battery going to die. Sorry guys.

651
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,400
This scares me man. It it just pumps my

652
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,600
heart up like

653
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,760
so basically I'm trying to do this now.

654
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,080
Uh it's about you using what you know

655
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,039
about what you see observing the world

656
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,240
and making I am free of the flock with

657
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,400
my wisdom like the wisdom being dumb. Uh

658
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,480
dumb means like kingdom I am my own

659
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,200
kingdom

660
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,880
you know. Uh and then let me just give

661
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
you I'm not going to do the whole thing.

662
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,760
Of course I'm not going to do the whole

663
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,279
thing. Be long. Uh then that's just the

664
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,440
character and it gives everything has

665
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,120
there and then other one that's a motion

666
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,240
that's the motion basically the motion

667
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,200
is like driven

668
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,559
so basically um what's the motive of the

669
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,880
character why are they free what do they

670
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,880
want it's like problem statement um

671
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
explanation what do they want um so

672
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
basically the obstacle they must

673
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,559
overcome is basically based on the you

674
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,120
see like the the the beginning middle

675
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,240
and end trilogy uh is based on something

676
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,159
called the the the the

677
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,559
Basically in all cultures guys there's

678
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,320
something called um

679
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,080
in all stories in all stories like

680
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
there's something called narrative like

681
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,880
narative I've got a hero hero journey or

682
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,159
the heroin's journey um but the

683
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
heroine's journey is like um the same

684
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,919
thing so this just the same thing

685
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,520
beginning and there's a happy ending and

686
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,279
we got like movies about them you know

687
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,200
that's what the media come from you know

688
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,679
they tell the story in pictures you know

689
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,640
moving pictures which are movies uh or

690
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,200
animation Uh so you got motivation

691
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,200
obstacle theme.

692
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:40,400
So this like uh basically the motivation

693
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,919
one one my purpose is uh uh free to act

694
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,440
free

695
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:49,840
to judge me not judge me not uh uh so

696
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,799
what's my question to free cuz you know

697
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:57,399
it feels limited it feels confined by

698
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,399
the flock free to act

699
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,919
free to act to be free to act Uh

700
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,080
uh basically you also define so it

701
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:13,440
obscures like um the um free to act

702
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,440
uh free

703
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,520
from judgment I'll come to um

704
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,240
curiosity

705
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,840
is my wisdom

706
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
basically it's curious and that's

707
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,840
supposed to be free

708
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,279
uh I build

709
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:36,720
Uh basically the wisdom, the kingdom.

710
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,120
Uh I am the um basically um I build I am

711
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,360
I build my own kingdom. Oh basically I

712
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,200
build my own kingdom.

713
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,880
I build one second. One second. Let me

714
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,600
try. Okay. I'm trying to make it better.

715
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,240
Uh city is my wisdom. I build my own

716
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,240
kingdom. I am my own kingdom.

717
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,240
I

718
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:04,640
I met uh quick my uh wisdom. Met

719
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,360
metamorphosize meta

720
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,600
move

721
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,600
um move to wisdom.

722
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,760
So basically I'm I am free uh of the

723
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,039
flock. With my wisdom, I build my own

724
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,120
kingdom. Uh, free to act. Free from

725
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:34,880
judgment. Curiosity is my wisdom.

726
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:37,880
I move. I I move. I transform. Uh, I

727
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,880
move.

728
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,720
I move. Uh, I move. Um,

729
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,720
I move.

730
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,640
Sovereign sovereign sovereignty

731
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,640
I

732
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,080
declare my sovereignty basically I I

733
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,840
declare uh my sovereignty like you know

734
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,880
my freedom

735
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,919
I declare my freedom

736
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,480
uh I declare my sovereignty

737
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,399
I am

738
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,080
free

739
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,520
basically that's basically see this one

740
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,200
is beginning, middle and end. So, I'm

741
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,080
teaching you how to guys how to do um

742
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,919
arting thing. Uh this like um the and

743
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,840
how to add rhythm. So, basically this is

744
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,640
just the this like the mind map for Z

745
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,640
regress. Uh you can check that out. But

746
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,080
you know Z1 was like um uh animation. Uh

747
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,080
then we got um uh so that's crisis. The

748
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,799
last one this like one I did for SIA the

749
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,559
stanza but that's in haiku. Uh so

750
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,200
basically uh pivots emotion

751
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:46,240
crisis uh piv basically the this is like

752
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,960
um uh crisis the crisis that happens the

753
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,880
pivots the change and then uh the motion

754
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,760
is like the resolution. Um so basically

755
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,840
the mission I am the I am the I am okay

756
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,120
free okay basically I have to say

757
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,200
something I am free of the flock

758
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,640
uh uh with my wisdom I build my kingdom

759
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,320
free to act free uh judge uh free of

760
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,840
judgment

761
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,880
free of judgment curiosity is my wisdom

762
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,880
I declare my sovereignty

763
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:27,000
free a free and the free uh free is the

764
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
flock.

765
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,320
Uh

766
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,799
as free

767
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,799
as freedom

768
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,279
can be

769
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,279
I am the freedom bird.

770
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,120
I am I am the freedom. So this like um

771
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,720
the poem now you see this crisis uh

772
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,080
pivot emotion I'm going to talk about

773
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,600
something else um but the writer's

774
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,760
framework I'll come to the other one

775
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
this just the let me quot so this one

776
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,799
here I'm going to try to read out to you

777
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,640
uh uh live not life so this one here so

778
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,960
I am it's like the about the bird kind

779
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,679
of thing so basically you see here so

780
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,279
let's see so this like the art I drew

781
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,600
and there's a reason why I drew it is

782
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,760
like because of this uh so basically you

783
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,600
can look at this first uh here I can't

784
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,080
really show you. This is some paper, but

785
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,519
it's like weird and it's like dirty. Uh,

786
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,399
but you know, that's what I'm think. So,

787
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,640
you got to remember, uh, this a doodle.

788
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:30,240
This a doodle. Uh, but the doodle is

789
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,519
like, uh, the last one, but this

790
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,440
everyone's basically everyone's at level

791
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,120
zero. Unless they, uh, if you think

792
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
you're level, if you try to draw level

793
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,440
three, uh, level one, two, uh, you're

794
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,799
zero because if it's just peer review,

795
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,399
your work, anything, you doing business

796
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,600
with anyone, uh, but you're level zero

797
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,159
automatically because you don't have

798
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,960
like, um, a thing expression. This your

799
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,440
expression. Uh but it's a doodle. Um

800
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,720
it's still a doodle and a sketch. So you

801
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,000
are either um doodling or or sketching.

802
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,919
But you don't this my expression. I

803
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,360
think I'm a level two. Uh but there's

804
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,399
other reasons to suggest I'm not level.

805
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,240
You have to think of other reasons

806
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,480
basically. So basically this freedom

807
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,720
bird is level zero. Let me think. It

808
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,320
could be level zero because he's just

809
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,720
outline. There's no actual um sketching

810
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,159
uh not sure form. But I can argue

811
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
there's more form than in doodle because

812
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,360
doodle is just boring stuff. Gives no

813
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,440
form. It's more abstract. So this I

814
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,440
would say this a level one but is it

815
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,440
authentic? Oh yeah it's like me. I am

816
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,880
free. Um so I would say I'm level two.

817
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,919
Yes. Level two. So this level two piece

818
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,080
of uh uh this level of freedom bird. So

819
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,159
it does match level two. Uh level one uh

820
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,440
level zero level one. Level two uh of

821
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
the authentic expression. This my

822
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
authentic expression. Now the po one

823
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,720
here is other one. So this is the

824
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,080
freedom bird.

825
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,559
I am free of the flock. Um I'm free of

826
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,919
the flock. With my wisdom I build my own

827
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,279
kingdom.

828
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,880
Free are to act. Free from judgment.

829
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,760
Curiosity is my wisdom. I declare my

830
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,120
sovereignty. Is that what it is? Free is

831
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,679
the flock. As free as freedom can be. I

832
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,799
am the freedom bird.

833
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,240
You get it? Freedom bird. So that's one

834
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,240
thing. So this thing is this level

835
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,480
three. But now this like a public key to

836
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,520
my artwork example. So if you go up to

837
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,720
the top uh so basically there's copy

838
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,320
infringement everything. So this is a

839
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,560
private key here. This will be the

840
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,240
freedom birth here. Uh the private key

841
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,079
is the freedom birth. Now the public key

842
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,000
I can give everyone the pool one is a

843
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,280
public key and that's the R protocol.

844
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,359
Now it's sample proof 2.5 percentile 0%.

845
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,000
If I see infringement on this work I can

846
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,520
sue anyone. Uh but you know that's our

847
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,720
protocol. The public key it shows to

848
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,000
everyone. It's free to see. But the poem

849
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,200
I can give to anyone but that's

850
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,399
interpreted because they cannot

851
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,159
interpret something that's very abstract

852
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,240
like that. So if I give someone this

853
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,760
poem, they see it as an art protocol.

854
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,119
They don't understand and then they try

855
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,960
to decipher it and they say, "Oh, what

856
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,119
did you draw?" But if I give someone a

857
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,359
poem and show them the art um I can

858
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,679
basically I can clear two poems. I can

859
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,440
give what this freedom bird means to me.

860
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,760
And they say, "Why did you create it? I

861
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,280
created a freedom bird uh because um

862
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,599
because I created a freedom bird because

863
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,839
I want to express myself." Yes. But you

864
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,320
know the poem here uh two I can give

865
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,160
them one poem uh everyone to see. I can

866
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,760
give them a little poem uh keep one

867
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,599
poem. So if there's any copyright

868
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,599
infringement, they see the freedom bird

869
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,599
and we and I say um if you go to court,

870
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,200
it's going to be a dispute. Uh so it's

871
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,119
going to be a problem. So the the the

872
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,960
the thing about this freedom bird is

873
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,160
that um the private it's a private key.

874
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,079
It's what it has to be. It has to be

875
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,880
separate. Uh it's going to be two to

876
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,359
one. It's like owner oral skill.

877
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,720
But the avatar is a basically uh if

878
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:34,320
there's an avatar basically this my

879
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,640
avatar. I'm the avatar. I'm the freedom.

880
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm the freedom. you know uh because

881
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,599
triggers like the trigger uh is like um

882
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,240
I trigger something like you know the

883
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,920
trigger is like me uh if I'm angry I'm

884
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,599
the avatar basically this is my

885
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,079
alternate expression this is my persona

886
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,760
this is my trademark work uh and then

887
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,440
legal automation uh the basically the

888
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,520
computer can check this a computer can

889
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
check this uh basically goes to

890
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,720
franchise nodes uh computing publishing

891
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,040
and art uh computing open computing open

892
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,119
publishing uh book arts like it goes to

893
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,079
write industry it goes to do the goes to

894
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,440
solve the problem. It's going to

895
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,119
basically it's going to be authentic for

896
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,240
that scenario for that biome for where

897
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,440
you are. Uh which I'm saying to you uh

898
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,000
this one zero is regret this like Z one

899
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,680
uh color palette Japanese ornament. But

900
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,960
this is like she meets basically she has

901
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,119
the devil in her room. She's cursing the

902
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,560
devil overnight praying overnight. Uh

903
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,680
you can look at this read it out this

904
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,839
article and this like the thing uh I did

905
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,440
this a stanza. Um so that's the freedom

906
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,640
bird for you. It's better because it's

907
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,000
more authentic. Uh uh but you know

908
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,920
that's going to be copyright everything

909
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,480
if you want to see it. Uh it's level

910
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,440
two. I'm glad I achieved it cuz it's

911
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,200
like uh there's a it's not like I stop I

912
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,119
didn't stop it. I just did it well

913
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,920
enough to my ability and I and I'm happy

914
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,720
with that specificity um with that art

915
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,760
uh protocol. Uh so um am I done with

916
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,240
this video? Yes. So uh so basically what

917
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,160
you guys do is create something that um

918
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,480
basically built in infrastructure as a

919
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:07,480
service. So as um architecture as

920
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,480
infrastructure a a

921
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,079
you know that's architecture as

922
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,839
infrastructure because the architecture

923
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
is built into the design basically if I

924
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,760
want to design this for use anything you

925
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,680
can design like a light uh like a a

926
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,839
light lamp that floats in like like a

927
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,520
light bulb like it does this that look

928
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,480
like this um and build it because

929
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,680
basically my company is designed to

930
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,520
clean company um but that's idea you

931
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,119
sovereignty you have the soul in it you

932
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,119
have what you want in it. Um uh yes,

933
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
it's like uh it is like that. So your

934
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,119
goal is to have the sovereign. Uh

935
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,240
anything I forgotten? No. Okay, I'll go

936
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,720
back to Thank you for watching this

937
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,240
video. Uh like, share, and subscribe if

938
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,800
you want, but this is just me reflecting

939
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,839
on my work. Um

940
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,720
uh uh Dr. Sovereign uh and have a look.

941
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,480
Take care. Here we go. So YouTube just

942
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,520
actually just caps this and put this

943
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,599
properly. Um so this is like a like a

944
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,079
thumbnail or something. So it's going to

945
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,320
be look like this skele.

946
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,800
But guys, I should not lose this. So uh

947
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:12,000
again NDI uh uh level zero is a doodle.

948
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,640
Uh level one is a catch. Uh level two is

949
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,040
external expression. Uh which is this.

950
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,480
Level three is symbolic uh or cultural

951
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
expression. Level four is authentic

952
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,800
expression. Level five is a

953
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,280
craftsmanship. Uh uh level six is

954
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,000
mentor. Level seven is um symbolic

955
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,520
expression. Level eight is activist. Uh

956
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,680
you can activist anywhere you can

957
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,440
basically can access activist any biome

958
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,760
you're in you can just observe the world

959
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,920
everything okay take you this is part of

960
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,320
the draw uh let's call it the artist

961
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
framework
