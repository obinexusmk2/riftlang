2
00:00:06.04 --> 00:01:02.62
[Speaker 1]: Okay, today, Today is the 28th of January,
2026. So it is the 28th of January, 2026,

3
00:01:02.38 --> 00:01:06.23
[Speaker 1]: yes. I have my section of papers, this is
the prior admission to hospital. But

4
00:01:05.81 --> 00:01:11.79
[Speaker 1]: literally, I'm going to read the last
year's date. In your case, the 28th day

5
00:01:11.63 --> 00:01:18.04
[Speaker 1]: ends on, ends on, it's on. So basically,
this is the 29th of January, 28th of

6
00:01:17.74 --> 00:01:33.04
[Speaker 1]: January, 27th. This is the 28th of
January, 27th. if I leave, you know,

7
00:01:32.58 --> 00:01:35.89
[Speaker 1]: because they are not abusing my rights to
housing and everything, but, you know,

8
00:01:35.81 --> 00:01:40.68
[Speaker 1]: it's not really in their power to detain me
anymore, you know, because I've not, I've

9
00:01:40.30 --> 00:01:46.22
[Speaker 1]: complied with the 8-day metric. So, this
is my story. So, it's basically, how long

10
00:01:46.08 --> 00:01:51.53
[Speaker 1]: would I be here? You're kept for up to 8
days, up to 2. During this time, you must

11
00:01:51.33 --> 00:02:02.66
[Speaker 1]: not leave unless your, let's tell you, you
may leave. uh yeah this is my therapist uh

12
00:02:02.47 --> 00:02:08.39
[Speaker 1]: but you know if you try to leave the store
can't stop you yeah i still can't stop you

13
00:02:08.27 --> 00:02:15.31
[Speaker 1]: the stuff with water it's not the stuff and
if you do if you do leave you can't If you

14
00:02:15.07 --> 00:02:20.36
[Speaker 1]: were already kept in hospital under
section 4 of mental health act, then this

15
00:02:20.16 --> 00:02:27.41
[Speaker 1]: time you would be in hospital for part of
the 8 days. So, section 4, not section 5.

16
00:02:27.17 --> 00:02:32.07
[Speaker 1]: So, if I leave and I get brought back, it's
telling me if you were already kept in

17
00:02:31.73 --> 00:02:36.64
[Speaker 1]: hospital under section 4, never of the
mental health act, then you would really

18
00:02:36.20 --> 00:02:49.64
[Speaker 1]: be in hospital as counsel. And you do this
today. Um, she's not here until another

19
00:02:49.50 --> 00:02:52.58
[Speaker 1]: day, but you know, I have to speak to
everyone. So, you know, I don't want a yes

20
00:02:52.46 --> 00:02:56.57
[Speaker 1]: from them. Yes, Natasha, Natasha, if, you
know, Natasha, if, you know, because

21
00:02:56.43 --> 00:03:00.09
[Speaker 1]: she's black in complexion, you know,
she's white, um, and I'm black, so, you

22
00:02:59.91 --> 00:03:03.32
[Speaker 1]: know, I don't really care, because she's
got a, a cool set, because she's got a book

23
00:03:03.10 --> 00:03:07.24
[Speaker 1]: down. But, you know, it's not, it's not my
position to live here. I have to speak to

24
00:03:07.18 --> 00:03:10.41
[Speaker 1]: the other one, because, you know, they
work together, it's just two people, it's

25
00:03:10.38 --> 00:03:13.49
[Speaker 1]: a two-people job, it's not a one-person
job. And this is why it matters, but, you

26
00:03:13.31 --> 00:03:22.85
[Speaker 1]: know, it's not, because they have a bias,
so, You don't care. Because I can't define

27
00:03:22.61 --> 00:03:28.21
[Speaker 1]: hate. I can't. I can't define hate until I
hate you. You see, I love you, but I don't

28
00:03:28.05 --> 00:03:37.79
[Speaker 1]: love you. Because I can't define love
either. End of story. So, what else? Let's

29
00:03:37.67 --> 00:03:42.02
[Speaker 1]: keep us in the frame of mind of a scientist.
Oh yeah. Brings me to the next point.

30
00:03:41.60 --> 00:03:46.23
[Speaker 1]: Consensus matrix. Consensus matrix. So,
the consensus matrix is literally the

31
00:03:45.89 --> 00:03:51.84
[Speaker 1]: sparse consensus matrix of love and hate.
Your love equals my hate. But, I think I'll

32
00:03:51.74 --> 00:03:55.67
[Speaker 1]: write it down. Yes, this is my plan. So,
your love equals my hate. So, this is my

33
00:03:55.37 --> 00:04:02.38
[Speaker 1]: plan today. to go out so it's a goal plan as i
showed them uh uh because hostel uh get a

34
00:04:02.32 --> 00:04:09.47
[Speaker 1]: new car a better new car um nationwide
hostel well get dressed in rafa not red

35
00:04:09.29 --> 00:04:19.82
[Speaker 1]: with raw money from my initial black
account and uh i'll go to council and

36
00:04:19.34 --> 00:04:23.74
[Speaker 1]: request uh housing but basically i'm
reading this online but i'm looking like

37
00:04:23.64 --> 00:04:29.55
[Speaker 1]: after now from third council so i can go to
third class directly or i can recover the

38
00:04:29.35 --> 00:04:37.00
[Speaker 1]: online service um recovery service is a
crucial but speak to havering um uh and

39
00:04:37.20 --> 00:04:37.24
uh

40
00:04:39.72 --> 00:04:43.41
[Speaker 1]: I think that's very clear. Maybe I should
have stayed one more day. Because I've got

41
00:04:43.37 --> 00:04:47.76
[Speaker 1]: to stay one more day. I should have stayed.
Anyway, speak to the hearing ahead of

42
00:04:47.38 --> 00:04:54.13
[Speaker 1]: time. So basically, I'm going to have
housing in Arafat. But Dan, I'm not going

43
00:04:54.05 --> 00:05:00.47
[Speaker 1]: to do it for you. but I've got a lawyer
involved in all this stupid nonsense but

44
00:05:00.41 --> 00:05:05.35
[Speaker 1]: you know it's not it's not that he hates me
it's just that it's just how it is in the UK

45
00:05:05.17 --> 00:05:09.26
[Speaker 1]: so the legal matter is I'm going to Nigeria
whether they like it or not you can hate me

46
00:05:09.12 --> 00:05:13.64
[Speaker 1]: for it you can love me for it I can't define
that I'm not you I'm not you I'll never be

47
00:05:13.46 --> 00:05:18.71
[Speaker 1]: you I'll never be you I'll never be no woman
like my mother no woman like my father you

48
00:05:18.57 --> 00:05:22.96
[Speaker 1]: know because I've I've done enough for
myself I've done enough to get out of this

49
00:05:22.56 --> 00:05:28.66
[Speaker 1]: situation or not I'll never be you so as I
said I do want to be detained, but, you

50
00:05:28.54 --> 00:05:31.64
[Speaker 1]: know, I want to get housing, because I know
the system, but, you know, I've been in the

51
00:05:31.38 --> 00:05:34.15
[Speaker 1]: rules, rules are not perfect, you can
break the rules, but that doesn't mean

52
00:05:34.03 --> 00:05:38.41
[Speaker 1]: I've been in the rules. So, I'm going to get
housing in Romford now, but I'm going to

53
00:05:38.29 --> 00:05:42.98
[Speaker 1]: have to try to get a lot of housing in
Romford via the Romford Council, because

54
00:05:42.92 --> 00:05:45.99
[Speaker 1]: I want to be discharged from Romford
Council, but I have to call Thorough

55
00:05:45.57 --> 00:05:49.95
[Speaker 1]: Council to be allocated housing, to be
discharged to Havering Council, because

56
00:05:49.79 --> 00:06:07.86
[Speaker 1]: the housing is in Havering. my right to
call them. To call them. To call

57
00:06:02.82 --> 00:06:12.17
[Speaker 1]: counseling. I've been this short. They
cannot say no to me on that anymore. My time

58
00:06:12.09 --> 00:06:17.87
[Speaker 1]: has run out here. The time is very
important because it fuses out like a

59
00:06:17.63 --> 00:06:25.14
[Speaker 1]: fuse. It fuses out. It runs out. It fuses
out means it runs out. It's like an

60
00:06:24.30 --> 00:06:37.46
[Speaker 1]: implosion. The term I'm saying now is that
the consensus before I go to shower, I have

61
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:41.68
[Speaker 1]: to go by my consensus matrix. So you get a
9x9 consensus matrix, which is like a

62
00:06:41.38 --> 00:06:45.76
[Speaker 1]: lattice space. So 9x9 is a different model
of a lattice. You get like a mesenchymal

63
00:06:45.62 --> 00:06:50.11
[Speaker 1]: system of consensus. But there's some
things in 9x9 that you need. So the lattice

64
00:06:50.01 --> 00:06:57.01
[Speaker 1]: is basically 9x9 because you've got 3 plus
3 human rights. You've got 9x9 is 81. So 99

65
00:06:56.77 --> 00:07:03.79
[Speaker 1]: is 81, so it's 81. So 99 is the dimension of a
point in space where that point is a 1 or 2 or

66
00:07:03.76 --> 00:07:11.76
[Speaker 1]: 3 that are related to give you some kind of
order via the lattice operation. So it's a

67
00:07:11.28 --> 00:07:15.93
[Speaker 1]: measurement system because the lattice
has a 9 by 9 system. And that represents 81

68
00:07:15.77 --> 00:07:30.78
[Speaker 1]: human rights. 3 plus 3, 3 times 3 is 9. 9
times 9 plus 9 plus 9 is 16. We have 15

69
00:07:30.34 --> 00:07:37.40
[Speaker 1]: dimensions, 15 lattices. We share 15
lattices of the universe in dimensions.

70
00:07:37.30 --> 00:07:41.25
[Speaker 1]: So 15 lattice dimensions that interact
with each other. Up, down, left, right,

71
00:07:41.19 --> 00:07:48.21
[Speaker 1]: the dimension of space-time. via a mosaic
memory model. So it's a mosaic memory

72
00:07:48.05 --> 00:07:52.30
[Speaker 1]: model that remembers you and covers you
into a system state. But basically,

73
00:07:52.18 --> 00:07:56.80
[Speaker 1]: you're going to have to do a consensus
matrix to determine what needs to hold,

74
00:07:56.72 --> 00:08:02.73
[Speaker 1]: and you don't have to hold that thing. So
for the system of what needs to hold, you

75
00:08:02.31 --> 00:08:14.21
[Speaker 1]: cannot tell me what needs to hold. of token
type, token memory, token value, and

76
00:08:13.67 --> 00:08:20.58
[Speaker 1]: token type and token kind. And the kind of
data there resulted in heterogeneous and

77
00:08:20.18 --> 00:08:32.08
[Speaker 1]: homogeneous states of data. So I'm trying
to literally have a system for a

78
00:08:31.48 --> 00:08:43.24
[Speaker 1]: metaphysical layer of So we don't have to
hold so much evolution as the

79
00:08:42.68 --> 00:08:47.77
[Speaker 1]: meta-universe evolves. It's a digital
space, but it's a metaverse. So I call it a

80
00:08:47.11 --> 00:08:54.62
[Speaker 1]: metamorphosis. It's not silly. It's a
metaverse. So it's a metaverse beyond

81
00:08:54.28 --> 00:09:00.31
[Speaker 1]: living, which can be digitized via
quantum tunneling. But it's basically

82
00:08:59.67 --> 00:09:05.50
[Speaker 1]: instantaneous because it holds the same
shared data within this physical reality

83
00:09:05.39 --> 00:09:11.53
[Speaker 1]: and the mental reality of the mind. It's
basically an astral protector with a

84
00:09:09.79 --> 00:09:18.82
[Speaker 1]: computer, with a divisor device. The term
hoarding refers to consensus hoarding.

85
00:09:18.60 --> 00:09:23.67
[Speaker 1]: You need food, water and shelter. What are
the dimensions of food, water and

86
00:09:22.54 --> 00:09:30.32
[Speaker 1]: shelter? Sleep is the bottom one. Do you
need sleep? Do animals need sleep? No. Red

87
00:09:30.13 --> 00:09:36.61
[Speaker 1]: ants don't need sleep. They don't. But
black ants do. to operate, but, you know,

88
00:09:36.45 --> 00:09:40.41
[Speaker 1]: red ants, I've never seen a red ant shut its
eyes and sleep, so I know they don't sleep,

89
00:09:40.25 --> 00:09:44.84
[Speaker 1]: because, you know, I've been playing with
them as a child, for experimentation, but

90
00:09:44.66 --> 00:09:49.05
[Speaker 1]: the red ants are literally the things that
don't sleep, don't need to sleep, they

91
00:09:48.75 --> 00:09:53.63
[Speaker 1]: don't have that, so sleep is not needed in
their consensus reality of being an ant,

92
00:09:53.07 --> 00:09:56.92
[Speaker 1]: so, you know, but, you know, the ant's
model is basically, you know, as we're

93
00:09:56.78 --> 00:10:01.48
[Speaker 1]: human beings, so we can lose the dimension
if we don't have that model of consensus,

94
00:10:01.30 --> 00:10:10.07
[Speaker 1]: because we need to eat, sleep, and poo, and
I need to sleep So it's basically how to

95
00:10:09.85 --> 00:10:16.02
[Speaker 1]: protect myself into a state of being via
consensus holding, holding a kind of

96
00:10:15.76 --> 00:10:19.99
[Speaker 1]: system of accountability. Because you
get a negative space where you share and

97
00:10:19.89 --> 00:10:23.25
[Speaker 1]: you don't need it, you don't need to hold
it, which is rift triplet. So rift triplet

98
00:10:23.21 --> 00:10:28.62
[Speaker 1]: is basically rift problem. Breathing is
not optional. Living is not optional.

99
00:10:28.44 --> 00:10:34.01
[Speaker 1]: Only working is optional. So my love is
your hate. I cannot define, I cannot

100
00:10:33.69 --> 00:10:39.68
[Speaker 1]: define, I cannot define I love to hate you
in my framework of Igbo man, my

101
00:10:39.30 --> 00:10:47.94
[Speaker 1]: sovereignty. But these are terms that
intertwine. Because love is hate.

102
00:10:47.72 --> 00:10:51.93
[Speaker 1]: Because if there's love, there's this
hate. And that's what you need to love.

103
00:10:51.81 --> 00:10:57.35
[Speaker 1]: That's what you need to love yourself. I
love myself. I love me. O-B-I, which is the

104
00:10:56.97 --> 00:11:03.44
[Speaker 1]: persona of me. I love me. Eze, which is
another persona of me. And I love you, me.

105
00:11:03.34 --> 00:11:10.05
[Speaker 1]: Me, myself, and I. I love I. Uche. But this
is in the own reality. So these are three

106
00:11:09.78 --> 00:11:16.20
[Speaker 1]: people that are called Namdi. When you
say, I love you, Nnamdi. No one said that to

107
00:11:16.16 --> 00:11:21.87
[Speaker 1]: me before, and I'm very glad about that.
So, it is not a dystopian. It is a reality I

108
00:11:21.57 --> 00:11:25.58
[Speaker 1]: share, and I have to manage with the
paperwork. But I love myself, so because

109
00:11:25.52 --> 00:11:29.34
[Speaker 1]: I'm from Nigeria, I'm not British. What
I'm saying is, the kind of consensus

110
00:11:29.02 --> 00:11:38.41
[Speaker 1]: matrix I'm inventing is 27. But it's 9 plus
3. 9 to the power of 3. not 19 straight

111
00:11:38.17 --> 00:11:43.52
[Speaker 1]: because that defines the shared space
that needs to hold at the time and that's 27

112
00:11:43.44 --> 00:11:47.95
[Speaker 1]: we don't need to hold 27 units of diameters
that which is lattice and it's mosaic so

113
00:11:47.75 --> 00:11:51.41
[Speaker 1]: obviously it's color-coded it's
color-coded spins of quantum numbers um

114
00:11:51.33 --> 00:11:56.100
[Speaker 1]: it's color-coded of quantum qubits that
determine the color of a solar system of um

115
00:11:56.92 --> 00:12:02.14
[Speaker 1]: of non-linear no polarity uh because
non-polarity means that there's no

116
00:12:01.88 --> 00:12:07.37
[Speaker 1]: sequence of instructions that's linear
and you have a pathway you don't have a

117
00:12:07.09 --> 00:12:12.12
[Speaker 1]: specific definition it's called a system
that's not polar and it's non-linear but

118
00:12:12.02 --> 00:12:17.07
[Speaker 1]: it's polar but it's not you cannot have a
non-polarity you have an inverse

119
00:12:16.60 --> 00:12:21.67
[Speaker 1]: non-polar but you can have every unit you
move on but it's like a game if you don't

120
00:12:21.51 --> 00:12:25.42
[Speaker 1]: know i'm saying it's like a video game so in
a video game you have ways you can go but you

121
00:12:25.30 --> 00:12:35.17
[Speaker 1]: can have rigid controllers so you can in
that game, no glitch spot. So that's what

122
00:12:34.81 --> 00:12:38.68
[Speaker 1]: prevents every pathway you should
perform, every path you go, every shape

123
00:12:38.54 --> 00:12:43.50
[Speaker 1]: you take. If you become, if you've got a
quality streak, your quality doesn't

124
00:12:43.13 --> 00:12:46.66
[Speaker 1]: glitch, and you can have a cooldown, and
you know, it doesn't matter what the game

125
00:12:46.48 --> 00:12:51.21
[Speaker 1]: is, whatever you take is preserved, via
consensus is needed to preserve

126
00:12:50.81 --> 00:12:54.95
[Speaker 1]: something that's basically and because
this is what you need uh permission

127
00:12:54.77 --> 00:12:58.04
[Speaker 1]: requires authority uh but you need
permission there's no authority in my

128
00:12:57.76 --> 00:13:01.86
[Speaker 1]: framework for it because you don't need
permission this is a one it's not an eight

129
00:13:01.78 --> 00:13:05.37
[Speaker 1]: it could and should happen because it
could doesn't mean you should you should

130
00:13:05.30 --> 00:13:08.93
[Speaker 1]: it should does not mean it would you have
would happen either so she could should

131
00:13:08.69 --> 00:13:17.17
[Speaker 1]: would would you do it yes or no well could i
do it yes maybe would i do this and you go to

132
00:13:16.78 --> 00:13:20.97
[Speaker 1]: wouldn't I do it? But that's the
permission of the Trident permission. So

133
00:13:20.85 --> 00:13:25.96
[Speaker 1]: the permission has Trident model, three
models that you get. The consent. Could I

134
00:13:25.82 --> 00:13:32.23
[Speaker 1]: have sex? No. I want sex. No. I need to have
sex. No. But the goal of this is to have the

135
00:13:31.75 --> 00:13:36.57
[Speaker 1]: consent shared. And the only consent is
shared. So the consent of a peer-to-peer

136
00:13:36.35 --> 00:13:41.18
[Speaker 1]: people, two people ask them, of a
peer-to-peer topology is a consent

137
00:13:40.36 --> 00:13:44.24
[Speaker 1]: framework. So the consent is what the OB
contract is also, you know, consent to. So

138
00:13:44.10 --> 00:13:49.32
[Speaker 1]: that's the OB-S contract. So
peer-to-peer or bus, which is like a...

139
00:13:49.12 --> 00:13:54.48
[Speaker 1]: the bus topology, which is like the
topology of having a bus network

140
00:13:54.06 --> 00:14:00.29
[Speaker 1]: topology. The indictment of a systemic
epidemic IP address them. IP address

141
00:14:00.17 --> 00:14:06.00
[Speaker 1]: them. So IP address them is because it's a
concept of a kind of system of having the

142
00:14:05.38 --> 00:14:13.93
[Speaker 1]: non-polarity boot sequence of OBSS. It is
defined. It's polar defined. But it's

143
00:14:13.59 --> 00:14:16.84
[Speaker 1]: needed. It's consensus is needed. You
don't want that part to be there. It's just

144
00:14:16.59 --> 00:14:21.86
[Speaker 1]: needed to have a response to that service.
It's not the kind of rigidity of computer

145
00:14:21.52 --> 00:14:28.13
[Speaker 1]: systems in the framework of open access.
But the good part of open access is every

146
00:14:27.83 --> 00:14:32.28
[Speaker 1]: part, way, shape, or form, there is a
solution to your problem because the

147
00:14:31.92 --> 00:14:39.46
[Speaker 1]: problem is defined. to show your quantum
spin. And that's why that works that way

148
00:14:39.04 --> 00:14:44.100
[Speaker 1]: though. It's not hard to do. It's just that
you have to find an array and give

149
00:14:44.05 --> 00:14:50.77
[Speaker 1]: everything an array of quantum spin. No
matter if it's a spit and that person is

150
00:14:50.61 --> 00:14:54.27
[Speaker 1]: really supervision and interference to
solve that problem so you can take any data

151
00:14:54.21 --> 00:15:00.58
[Speaker 1]: you want um uh any data but you have to get
that rate to be non-rated so diary has a

152
00:15:00.18 --> 00:15:04.02
[Speaker 1]: solution in a search space and that's the
person who has a tomographic which is an

153
00:15:03.78 --> 00:15:15.77
[Speaker 1]: area over a pi pi pi over four pi over three
pi over two and pi for one which is pi get the

154
00:15:15.49 --> 00:15:21.30
[Speaker 1]: system resolve itself tomographically
via the area of radium which is pi over 180

155
00:15:21.22 --> 00:15:26.58
[Speaker 1]: and pi over 270 million times there's some
degree some angle pi of 180 times some

156
00:15:26.32 --> 00:15:29.75
[Speaker 1]: angle like 45 degrees or 25 degrees and now
reserve the surface of the
