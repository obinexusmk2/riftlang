Okay, hello guys. Today's video. I want to really talk about something really decent. I'm trying to steal everyone's aura in the past. People actually can help us. You know, for me, I think it's just one initiative to do something for them, because students may not know the solutions are a problem. You know, it's called PLP, for the multicultural principle as a protocol. You know, guys, today's video is very important to me. You know, it means something to me as a child. Basically, someone called Mr. Salem is a bi direction. He's bi directional. Basically, Mr. Saleem was a teacher of French, you know, he was a good friend teacher. I love that man, you know, you know. But normally people were a student, you know, it was in first school for me to talk to you about Mr. Mr. Selling, you know, you know, I had to, had to really look at him like, like him as he was, you know, you have to find out. You know, why it was that way. You know, he was strict in class. It was, it wasn't like hard anything. It wasn't. It wasn't hurting anyone physically. But he knew how the system works, and he's telling us about our lives everything he taught. He teach you, teach you, but you don't know he's teaching you. You know this man, he doesn't understand all this problem. Mr. Slim was a teacher. Was a teacher. Teacher, I loved, you know, I loved him because he was able to communicate effectively to me. He knows others, but, you know, in a more African way, you know. But it was, it was modest. Wasn't like, pushy. It was like, I know you do it or not, you fail, you know. Okay. Mr. Lim was a French teacher. I was nine years old. No, no, I was nine years ago. I was 11 years old. I got a French class. No, Mr. Lee Selim had a French but he didn't speak English. You know, the French class speak French. Not who got that? But understood that very well. You know, Mr. Selim understood that French was from French class only. You know, you know, you're French. With him, you talk French. No one of English. Can ask in French if you want to hear English, but you don't say anything in English. You know, Mr. Flynn wasn't powerful. He's a killing the laws couldn't change anything in the school. He was just a puppet to them as well, like me to you know, they don't strike me myself, but he was a poet in school, no, and he was French, but, you know, no one's English. But for me, I'm not a puppet. No more. I am. I am transcending the cycle of oppression, depression. Now, Mr. Slim may not be me able to do it, but I'm doing all his behalf. You know me. He may go, forget it, never see his video, you know. He may never find his video. He may never see what this was I'm doing for him. You know, here, but Mr. Salem, thank you very much. You know, you know. I think about it. I talked about it today. Day is 14th of November. Mr. Slim, you know you are. You are one of the best teachers there, whether you know it or not, you deserve a good medal. You know two good mothers for that and why I'm still in the swimming. I first came to school when I was 11 years old in Newham. Look, let me see your aura. You know I'm gonna do for you and teachers like you. You know. You know, you know. So, you know, by directional infirmary, you know, this is a great thing to understand. You know, Muslim didn't know everything. He doesn't know everything, but he was able to communicate bi directionally. This was two languages, you know, you can go to French class and mingle, you know, then go to english class and mingle. You know, he was able to navigate the system, you know, much better than me at the time. I can go French, you know, but he's able to really good communication very well. Guys, you know, you've been able to even speak pigeon or like an African, like the broken English or the slang in the UK, and formally, you can even go through everywhere. You can't go through any the hood. You can't go through the chief accepted. Guys, you know, if you speak a street talk only. Can't go through the parliaments, through the formal processes, do legal actions. You know, things are very formal. You know, can't do it. You know, there's no way. So that's why bi directional learning is very important. What does mean? And you you know you speak English, I speak French. You can still communicate with one language. You know English. You know if you speak French, you speak English. You wanna speak French. We switch the French. This really means a lot to me. Guys, you know, I'm not doing it for the cloud. I'm doing it because it's all modest, honest. You know, I want Mr. Slim to think think of me, you know, actually making something better for everyone else. You know. I want to think of him me as he succeeded. You know, Mrs. Lim, you know, you may not know what this means to me, but you know, if you only know one language, it doesn't mean anything to me. You don't see your is not political. The first now the bi directional learning framework. You know, you know, if anybody isn't teaching a language in French, you know only any language, Spanish, anything. You guys, if I put a sign from my door, guys, I'm not joking. I put a sign, no English, only French. You know, only French if you enter that class or that room, you know that environment, I don't hear anyone, children, adults. What's a word of English? You know, if I put, if there's only if I put only English, even coming to only English, if I put only French, guys, not a word of English in your life. In that car, you be out in a second. Guys, I'm doing for everyone. Don't you want to learn French or English or Igbo on sibling? True positive, true negative, true, false, positive, false metrics here, you know, the bi directional learning clothes. You know, these are the things that enforce the person makes the work. You know, direct the evolution or direction, but evolution, diverse kinematics problem. You know, if you don't know, you can act in French. You can take your phone and trust me, in French, as long as they never hear you as a wife, English Guys, guys, you know, Mrs. Lim, you know, I'm doing this. You know, if I sign on my door morning, French, guys don't even utter, oh, a word of it in French. You know, can find a slang one of it. I don't really care if it sounds slang, although it's called immune to the French is first something called a French language. You know, guys, you know, please, please, for the sake of humanity. For the sake of humanity. When I'm teaching anyone adults, you the children, I don't care. Look, don't be good child into my class. Basically all the very special structure, you know, if the design of the data structure is registered, it's not flexible enough. You know, all my classrooms are have ways, English place, French place, guys, I don't see anyone in English section or English time speaking French. You know, when the time was up, no second of it
