It's a recording. OK, basically it's the same thing I'm saying. Yeah, so basically I should be recording the voice. So so basically this video is on quantum computing, but you know a good formal picture here for basically to see much of string between basically for the roof stage 3/2. 4640 again this is 0 is a new state is Alexa which is a stage 1 Steve Alexa is Alexa on this stage 2 is deposit if you go to the risk protector. Reflected this at. Github here, but we've got a lot of diagrams that you want me to show you. But I don't wanna dwell on. To show you here. Unless the documents here are here. So you've got a lot of images to see, guys. There's nobody. A lot of PNGS. But I want you guys to look at this up. But it's a dimensional conflict ELER basically UL is left rotated, R is rotation, but these are. Based on priority. So you got the risk. Basically get X is an input of dimension so you got X an input is in learning cycle and E sub L or is the epsilon of X to Y which is non chemical. Where there's no there's no one uses a space at a time, but you know, that's a seat, you know, So that's gonna seem to harvest basically 'cause we can cut this diagrams here, you don't have to. Here what I'll say here, but you got all these things you can. Look at at anyone, uh, point in time, uh, input stream the coding space, apply, you know, into. If you go to the articles, you're gonna, you know, communicate also. I get the money, they got the sparse and coding. No simplex sparse encoding. But you know, basically because it all goes here, but it's just a. The way you can do it without. Applica for a question. Basically if you have a transformation cancellation ticket, you cannot put information. Basically it's transformation instrument space rotation system of wireless systems like for each function. There's a polarization of rotation, translation, enlargement, and polarization. Across all the dimensions of cartesian for dynamic systems so the goal is here for me to explore this Modi so basically I've got to tell you guys to basically rough is a flexible translator is the pressure trying to work for PGS computer, but we do talk about the. The system push to be single,nd instruction. The hopper goes right a little goes to low data or should be. So basically risk is like a a first load to come and see what is. I do like brisk for evolution because everything's part of a CISK complex. The. Duality program 'cause you know there's some kind of substrate that's shared between risk and social architectures and that's quantum computers, you don't present computers. So basically what I do risk, I want it to be risk first because you know you're allowed to load stuff. But we know. But the limitation of this is that. And our act will not be the future at, you know, so we have to have some kind of binding, but that really solved easily. We don't want to add some overhead plug library. There's no point of doing that because we're just handling architecture. So basically The thing is like, you know, if you have no effect. If you have no 'cause, if you have no question to do something, know how to what, how to why, how to when, how to do, how to do you don't. If you separate this how to from the why the five wives, you only got the cause. How is the architecture. So when someone asks us after. Have the course so if you wanted them to do how to do how they want how to what give structure and also next some moments another assembly language and rift stage 1212 to ensure that the rest of how. So this assembly language is going to be only rooftop so basically you're gonna have a rift as a confirmation of doing any new tools, but you know they're gonna have problem with this. You can have the other one branch out from rift, which is not. Too long you can have a assembly language from British street with the 3222 you know so roof 222. Stage 1 is Alexa, it is 2 is a puzzle. This one is a 0 structure. Stage 1 is puzzle or one one stage 2 is assembly. SST So from AST and to 3D 3223 of E3E3 you get the assembly. So basically with the Http://libraries to. Uh, so the reason I still I used to to write a a three, but it doesn't mean to go to 111 for so So basically Rifter is a flash translator. You can go to the rift repository, but you don't have to match the. Instructor of this other clinical functions factors on the fly fly basically it's a really if you know what is just in time compiler basically what's the left assembly ecosystem is like a jet it's not a jet basically it's a it's nothing just. To comply, it's like a, it's, it's a, it's a, it's a roughly compiler, it's interpretation. It's not just, it's not just in time. You comply because you know that means you have to obviously you interpret, so you compare first. When you compile, you then interrupt for the architecture. So we want to make sure that we get to. The compound ref 3 stage 222 be written the compiler with you know you'll ask you to bridge to we want you to just what we need. So the architecture of which to just assembly components now give you how you want to organize your later memory. UH-44 divide show modeling uh. The supermission which I want to build a supermission or: please ring. Which is important for some people this assembly has an iot interface and have to ensure this this unit can be decoupled. And then I and then I it's getting a bad practice with three, three and then I have a dependency reasoning 33223 you know something else that is free. It's not a couple. So if the couple or at all the sparse model. But you know, risk is more personal. I love risk. I love, but the term ad is too rigid. So I don't know that you can say can find something that so the word ad is not going to be encoded into the system. It's more a rough pointer to the whole operation of adding what you call the function. You know, so especially I'm going to give you the definitions of the thing to do today, but let me try to get it down more fully. So let me try to give you some Python code. So pseudo coding pattern, so. So define deaf deaf. So basically you have to call it cola Cola cola function. Khali is born being called and the koala is then called the first again deaf koala koala and then you get some property to call it the team being called which is just the next pointer basically if you want to remember the secure like a request. Response next was like a rotten service. So if I had to call the caller then has access to other properties, access to other properties of the calling because you know, it's basically it's a function spawning. So the cooler spawns the cooling, you know, so the cooler says. Call a call basically can be anyway Cooler can have it as a policy like at at at, at, at column. Cool so you can call the police statistically call our death caller, death caller, I think if you have one functional quality. No cooler obviously caller the call so so deaf cola cola XY I think XYZ Cola, we'll have the call. So basically you got also say especially it's usually trying to do properly, so call me. So can you put the call up, call the caller caller dot XYZ so you get the functionality. Find some so X is a variable and why it's a variable and they have some input ** equals to. A cooler next, next coolie. I'll get it guys. OK, so let me do it properly now. So get a death call. That's cool lah, we got the input. Request a response get error error request response next because rotten so we get the code up error request or something they'll get the request is input error between. They're they're sports. You can have it as error request response, or you can have it as a error request error response. So you have a three particular form you can take it you have error. Error or error error, error or with error or result error result and you get error or. Or error request. Response you get error. Yup, it's just the cola. So the cola is the Seagate cola. Uh, error require? So this one say so this is the four it supports based on the So these are just so now you have the XYZ, so the XYZ access. So if you have you only can spawn three at a time. Why so you the color is equally the difficulty. So this I used to call it. The computer's IGK. But you know if I have igk, I have 3 dimensions, so the current pointer to I is X, the pointer X. You know the the the type C5 points I put it in because you're mapping them heterogeneous. So I JK is the homogeneous indexing like numbers, numeric indexing. Again the KXYZ which represent structured indexing queries from mapping. For trade taxes consistency, so. That you can't find so, so can you ask me? X equals if X is an axis, X equals. Soft, which is the software core. OK, solve the yield yield. Now yield is just. This is the first yield. Excuse me no no if i put X is yield but i'm posing i'm waiting do OK, I don't. If I yield in this state, I'm staying at AI want to build some input. So after input if I just pause, but it's like a general pause. Basically this post is a sequence. This pausing is a sequence to Algeria. Uh, utensils pulling is waiting for some kind of, uh, dinner packet or something to signal something, but it's not indefinitely way. It's meant to like, umm, basically it's a consumer observer consumer model, uh, for easy modeling. So function, but you go to your store. Now you start is you. All inputs, so that'd be requests. You can only or the iterator. So if I hear the iterator, uh. Adobe, you stop, uh, if I would OK, if I used to eat triple uh, that would be the IDK, indexing, uh, all the in this in the list on my own. That would be so, so be so X contains, uh, if I don't resume XI, then get I get. The intervals are just a list, but you know if X is false it has been deleted. Let's read something so you get XYZ. So if I get XY and do XY as a tuple equals yield. Yield some importance resource. So if XY is a vector, you can get XY. You can compute for Z, so compute for Z. So when you're using X-ray. Why you're using them? Sometimes you get extra wishes for one and why for two? So why don't you just focus to get 2 states you're observing at the time? So, so, so if I want to call the session to call you, X is a state substitute of the colleague. So that's coming. Post resumed and continued critical reaching so that the pause resumed pause the regime. So that's the idea. So if this is so, I'm going to define a chemical state for the. So if X state X of. He has some kind of X of UX of 11 cycle Hamiltonian that can't cost it if you're doing operation. So the goal of this is to have two sparse model. So if you have a note, if you have something, if you have some, if you know the system, you have something that can live. They can go to something I'm back, but can go to it. It doesn't. Basically it's a tripod, but it didn't use consent consensus to do it. So for example and all it can be something with some can be like some kind of inputs. That has to go to two channels. Supposed to be so good enough because yes you see this this will move me. Are guys real numb because they don't know so she's submitting this is here, so this. So this is like AXY, so XY itself that XY was XYZ of a constant. But that's all stuff now. Because, you know, I'll talk to give you the full overview now. So why do any of this? Why do anything? The corner can call the consumer and the consumer can call the caller. It's it is what it says to call out Concord, some consumer and. So this is this is this is sports graph. So it's here, it's meant to be here. So you get this possible here. To get a, a, a. So basically when you have a state, one state come in one state, you can be in two states. So you know if you're 1 state, if you're measuring one state. I'm trying to get 2 states in a class system. So but it's already there in the class system. So you know there's two things to observe on Tuesday. So if I'm assuming one. I am so beautiful so if someone wants to these two states to make sure especially if I'm measuring A2 path, 2111 path one. If I mention 111 path, basically there's two. If I mention 211 parts for 12, there's four parts. In total, there's 411 parts that have to use a small opportunity to do based on how I push it from and. Wouldn't be important most person there's full there's no full Hamiltonian parts because of 88 parts total. You know this, everything goes to the power of at what end is the leading time bound. So try to scale this to north squared. So basically your n ^2 computation is this classical equivalent of 2 N, you know 2N invariant. Could be consoled at in at no time through the n ^2 has quite so that idea. So what else? So it's not a. It's not a. So it's meant to be a start. So get a *11 Easter 11 function DY. So I've got the version here. I'm just gonna get it here. So I got it here. Just come and get the image here is it here go. Why don't you know? So, so I'm going to show you guys why really why this really matters to me for basically with test based tomographic, it works on like measuring areas with the chested area of the system. 2nd sparse model. So you get a sparse model of the commercial we can use as a match for the states because you just have to this you can just you don't really have them but tomography some more submission area. So you use the permit what you know about the surface area to give you the density of a dimension. So for example. Much and also you have like a A so basically gonna take the flags and use that to match the test 'cause you know that's the better thing. So there's one to one kind of collecting. So you take the global G for global iPhone sensitive T for top down, B for bottom up models on flags. Business architecture and do so through. You know, because you know this solution to it's down there. So she just said this lee i'm trying to define some kind of put my notes here here. So basically I'm trying to signature because the Python keyword and the. A good, I know 'cause you really don't use that problem. So uh, you know, inertia, uh, got the uh FN keyword, uh, which stands for uh function in Rust, which is same thing. I have a def keyword in Python, so FNR def about what I call signatures. So basically. Zhou can zhukun of this value token that the FN keyword is a R a signature for a function, a function. So on the def queue. Now if you have the full system get FN FN main which is like the token type the function. I mean which is the same thing as death death FN main with pattern,: and the right. You know, and that's you know, right, Because so these are two definition. This is signature from the thing you're gonna do is to just pick up encoding signatures. So the the the the introduction of system doesn't look here over functions. So I'm basically a kind of a functor can be defined by the. Specification Because the specification of the language is a target, you know can determine the target binary. Binary, which is just a if you go to if you go to this. Not easy to this time in Python you have the design in Rust, so disassembler. This is a model if you put this on your importance, but you know if you have some kind of if you have a binary shed. Linkable first and if you were finance the business recording for function or functor, I'm not going to functions. It starts to it doesn't stand how the how the function. A brick build how the detail how the logic not the business statement which is true or false expression, the model of the of domestic, dynamic or static and intent. The action to do. Oh beautiful, 'cause assembly is a architectural language, so you have to do something. It doesn't. It doesn't need to run a code, it just does. Obviously the architecture is slicker, so this must be sure that it's not rigid tomo graphically. So, so I go for example, here. So so this is the intent is like a the programs job or talks or like a a a child process. What's meant to do you know, you know what's meant to act on what it's meant to consume. And observe, you know what I mean to do for that system. So you get that here. She get the she get the the problem here, Sir, shall we go to here for you guys? So this is according to here. There's no glue on glue here it's just all glue that's so I got the letters it is, it's more, it is more Z. But you mean that means that you can start with this, You start from A-Z. That's when you study personas, not from like some letter. So basically. To the 5 / 2 this. No no no no ABC. So I'm not sure dude. So I get basically the first letter, the 1st letter to the 5th letter, and in between are all starring points. Business Centrality 1 to the five. I don't know why you're looking at me. I don't do anything to you. Go to Jordan. Stop this man. I don't give shirts. I don't give shirts. I'm busy. I don't give a ****. So OK. So so you get a letter L12 letter of English alphabet and 12 letter English or finish now finish video. Don't, don't don't disturb me. Don't don't disturb me, please, please don't disturb me. I'm busy. No, we don't. No, no, no, I don't. I don't. 12 letter word noble, 12 letter English alphabet. Don't think it says to me basically the 12 letter A BS12123456. That's wKAK. 12 No 25 uh, 25 minus uh. 4:50 Two. 1212 so 12 is K OK, but then K will be out, so that'd be. 678910 Level 1212 decay. So might of might have been K and their 12 will be up. So basically when I'm seeing all this thing, OK, OK. Oh oh, that rings a bell. That's perfect. So the idea is that K basically basically one is the number one on 25 star symbols but the return state, but the end symbols are really. The 12 months you get L, you get the KKO. OK. Oh OK. Basically KO resents some of the state based on how you modesty's. So you get 1 to the five. One or 12, you start from the first letter A, you get some transition to Z from Z, get some to A, but you know that's some pressure. You get some from K, you go to O, from O you get to K, but you're just the kind of cool X you get to symptom. If you want to go from A to L and then or Z to L, that will be. OK, really. Oh, you know, and K2L and really you see that's the only thing that stays the same because you know they that you know, you know, because. If I'm good, try and go from O to B so I can go to if I'm going to go from A-Z. I'm backwards. I'm the only reason I need to stay between central kit or usually center point, so I can compute from zero to 00 OK all of A to B because halfway halfway based on geometric alignment, so. You mean it's not what I'm going with this? Well, let's do this now. Basically you know what kind of problem as long as you follow it here because we defend from of clinicality in the system. So the idea of my people here, here, so you get here. So basically the problem is simple. To Z is 97 in decimal to 122. Now I'm 122 to 1987 all the way around. So you get a one way system. So you don't have to do this thing. There's any information. So you don't want to do what you want to Singleton. So you have the minimum. So you're going to get from a from small A. Which is 27th or number six or or or 61 to 7A and you get from.
