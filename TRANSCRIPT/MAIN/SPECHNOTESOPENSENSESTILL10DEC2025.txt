He has recorded a neither utter AI. Like a A1 year ago to start once again guys. There's one second. Umm, I go somewhere. This is a show video on Open Sense. Recorder. It's a open sense. Yup, it's recorded. No, it's not recording. It's recording here. Basically it's cooling here. So this should be recording 4th. Sorry guys, let me start this video now. Uh uh, so this is like, uh, my Alexa, uh, this is very important to stand, uh, basically called open sense metrics. Uh, open O for Oscar P for Papa uh E for echo N for November uh S for, uh, sensory E for echo N for November E for echo. No F for November, S for Sarah, E for Echo Dash. That's open since a - framework, because it's open to. And for Mother and for like AU, for Umbrella K for Kilo or for Oscar. So that's it is a micro OS. So this is open sense like the hardware application. So I'm gonna go back to here. I think you may be not understanding me, but you know, if you understand it, understand we got human rights. 7 * 7 So my side, my chest, my touch, my chest, my smell, my ears and my skin on my tongue 123-4566. Taste nose pretty touch and my intake, my intuition of my intake and my relay, my output, how I respond to him, my information processing via the temporal low and my. Local Glaminda or I don't know, it's a woman, but you know, it's with a flashback. So like, you know, I don't want to give you the jargon. Yeah, but you know, when is a fight is a flight. What is a fight is a fight. So basically in the fence of emperor system there, but it's normally belt to that. Some central position from a piece of fight of fly response. You know, in real time as well. Basically music that adapts to your space. For housing. It's very important you understand. It's just not for housing. It's for your mood. You know, having headphones using blue shirt. So basically blue shirt allows you to interact. Some instruments can be talking on a blue sheet network. Bluetooth that can share of art for people in aquarium and you can hear to them those are the things I'm trying to but you know, it's open sense boundary 'cause you know, these are things that you you have to usually clean like a broom at your house. You you put your headsets and you do your job. But you know, that has to be institutional person. You know, you know she's seen a room in A room, assisting your mood, calming your mood. That's what the open sense - matrix. So basically, you know, I don't want to give you guys the bigger term buffet perfectly first time. So I'm going to do it without going into the word words. You know, we can talk about this Alexa resume. I never feel this one. Alexa next. Alexa next. Alexa, pause. So basically, I'm not telling you basically. I love that last one. That's the third one. I love that the best one. Second was OK, but I wasn't really understanding it. And the first one understood it, but I couldn't make full sense of it. That's the third one. So I love the third one because, you know, I understand the song, you know? Alexa, so I'm doing a perfectly nice and the third song was like. Understood. Heart ratio. So in some kind of music theory, some kind of sensory. I like the sensor like I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding on special or some EDG as pictures bipolar and you really hear my bipolar, but the bipolar was some active stability. I felt like I want to get up on work. This kind of gym, this music for study, for work, but it's in your environment. It's like, you know, it's you know, it's the if you have the Alexa, you can pull up some timer or some blue noise, but that's not perfect. So you have to adapt to you actively to do that. When you want to turn off, you see it turn off, you know, no matter how tired you are, so you can actually do your work. Difficult. So that last song was really sounds. I'm not breaking the policies anything with no, there's no it's just you know, you know. On the media, social media, you know, so the last one was really get up to what? And that really made me do it. But you know, how do you make me do it? I understand the meaning. So it's kind of a meaning to it. And that means that my souls, my heart, my body, my mind, and also let me do it like a brothel puts you basically for assist people who want to actually. Basically, the music shift, no matter if they're fighting, fighting, fighting, the position of spark, that state of mind and Taylor is to calm down. But you know, there's no medication involved in this kind of thing, so it's usually preserving the environment that sustains them. That's why open sense is important. Open century precious metrics. So you get a 63 residence like you get 7 dimensions maximum for one person, but you get a shared dimension of certain service 49 for simple 63 shared spaces of dimension or accesses the dimension operation secure 7 dimension as maximum 7 times. Intersect in a business of how dynamic activity. So the open source matrix is bipolar too. So you got to, you got the bipolar measure, you got each unit because you get 14 to 40. 8 to 16 Obviously it starts from 8819111217. Is 14 so it gives you 8 to 14, but that's not good enough to get into 16 'cause you know, we double it instead to get the open sense something for due and protection feeling hungry and sad or some kind of complex emotion that company pinpoint or to find a signal in that motion so can put meaning to it so I can anger my spiritual. So that's what that's what I'm saying. So this. Opposition. Well, that's fine or I cannot. So don't be like a boring room like I mean, so this was open sensory. I'm afraid it's open sense on github.com. Open Access, open sense framework to for new Divergent, the idea of my home. Then it's just to have this things we like, we like and we don't like a good bit and a Barbie, you know, things that this is good. Some symphonies you can model with the school business, but it doesn't really resonate. It's not really active, it doesn't. Doesn't really understand your way you're feeling at that same time. Basically, it doesn't matter where you are, you know, it's gonna catch you up to you, you know, so you can tailor it to what you need. Some preset samples, you know, but it's like a genetic music. Gaming music I call the change of music because it allows you to. It's like, it's like the watch with noise, the wave noise format. I'm looking for the music. There's usually with some music. Basically uniformly, it's only program. It's just, it's just program seed that keeps off of it like two seasons of over 240 in the background. It's a background music for life, I call it. So that's it. No matter what the game is that we play a video game and you're shooting someone ecology the music for the background. Keeps you focused in the game because that book of music is your reality, you know, and that reality, if you stop that, if you press the stop button, you lose the version in the game too. So basically it's meant to keep you focused a week an active. For me personally, it means a lot no matter the the persons. Uh, but what does it really matter? Alexa Resume. So for me, it matters because you can hear enough see. It matters because, you know, if I close my eyes, I hear the music. I use my tears of smell. So I'm just actually my sense of smell. I'm reading, yes. Breathing i understand the music to see him it shouldn't get a signal for music obviously i want to try to this music is giving me meaning. There's a meaning to it, and the mean is one for the proof. Notice what I like it or not, that's why it's the matter. So there's a meaning to the way for the music of the sample, the hit hat. Basically the trouble, the high boot, the note, the spacing, the white. Most it is not to be voices can be like the Mozart kind of singing fairly, some kind of opera singing. But which is the best ones to do? Also kind of system that preserves you while you do it, but it's really a programming secure the background here you get the main ground reader, you get the foreground. So this is the foreground here I'm trying to put myself to the foreground. It's a messy room, but the foreground is not clear enough. So I can't really do my next thing because the. It's right, I'm getting a headache. So I close my eyes. The head goes, The music's making it go. Alexa, pause. So pause. So as you can see, the music is going now I can see myself, uh, focusing numb. I'm gonna, no, no, no. Now that basically that rhythm, if I go in the real world, uh, it just plays in my head and it, it keeps me stable. I don't have to get headache. I don't need any other things here. I think 'cause it's not, it's not really to go that obviously the, the goal of the system. They should show the flexibility for new beginnings in the head all the time, but that thing must not disrupt the flow 'cause you know it's not be there background when did not have it 'cause it it it is like an AOM. So just have an alarm that is calm. It doesn't really think about I start to play the the arena state. Of concentration, focus and hyper phonics and they're really themselves. They're being authentic. There's no it doesn't really affect the state of mind anymore because that state of mind has been because the work and they live and they breathe and they just start over them that's with them. They already know so they don't go back to some. Of them deviation from it so if they can sleep with him it's the best because you can sleep with their work with them live with the forever. But you know it's terrorism they're natural taking a cycle so basically no matter what they're doing they they they have this kind of music that that. It could be like a rain sounds. Alexa, play rain sounds. Alexa. Play blue noise. This is what this is blue noise uh, not the blue noise is beautiful uh, but I can hear it uh it just kills on my way phone on my problems. It feels like I'm something in the noise umm that I can resume because it's noisy, but allows you to focus 'cause there's no other noise at here. The choice is a Blizzard. Oh so beautiful guy, so she's similar guys you. I do it, but there's something there that's popping my constitution. I am focused on this. I want Mrs. Seymour clearly, but with my ears and my mind is some kind of resources that. Play with Alexa. Play whale noise. Alexa, please Alexa, pause. So that's like the white noise one. It does the same thing. It, it just more focus on the umm, uh, uh, like, you know, it's like a busy voice. Uh, umm, the noise, uh, basically noise, uh, police are for generative lattices, umm, just like a generally, umm, gently, uh. Did you want to come randomness too much? Really was like a microcosm before waveforms. Got that one, then you got that one like a a. You collect a modulator, the noise appearance you know is 1 and you get the piecewise noise you get like the parallelism you got other type of noise you can use to generate entropy in the system. But you know the goods have it able to region itself and evolve as it relates without individual by watching the daily activities, how they touch stuff, what they do you know. The need for medication initial form as a policy member forcing like some kind of youthful at least have a place to listen to it if not in your house, so you have like a local still rooms back. This is a room that you have, but this is your room. It's like your room, but it's still so you can work there if you want, but it's something useful and it's an extra. You have, because still you still come, still Conservatory. So basically you have two configurities. Everyone has to cover to them. But you know, you have a storeroom entering a store of grocery, a store covering a lot of species to bring, you know, 'cause you know, if there's any recognition, you start to decay here and it's the go mad. So you get once the room 'cause it won't be the room advisor, Sir, I get 11 Conservatory, it's in the garden and 1 garden is the government and you know, you get the controversy. That's the garden, the one in Karachi garden to have the food. So you can have one food once you want, you can. Smoking cigarette, you can use it anyhow you want, but you got to discover for the food for plantation there anything you want to do, whether that corn, corn hobs or weeds or grain or rice, yam, pepper soup and go see things that you love you, don't you? Prepare us. You don't, you don't have to go to the shop 'cause they grow on the ground naturally. Or the young food. Yeah. First of all, it goes inside the ground. That's kind of vision. So that's good. So basically the goal of this is to ensure that there's no fragmentation in the foundation. Need to feed, water, shelter, Alexa. Play wheels sounds. Alexa. Never mind. Alexa Resume. So basically it's my it's my favorite one guys this is like a wheel singer basically. We have good for detail. Do you love shrimp? That's what it sounds unique. You know, the blue, but the hunt for a ****. But you know. So beautiful guys, especially I want especially well on a journey to me. Basically it's a will that you know, we can't see can see them, but they're so big. So now this world is going up and down. Basically it's voice acting for sound. I'm doing so basically it's a voice for sound, but I'm being the basically I'm trying to go to the. Oh, I'm going to speak to my friend. Oh, hello, how are you? License is fine, but it's technically the story up in my head. Uh, he says, oh, you know, come to me. Someone will come with you. I want to come with you. Or 50 meters, A Congo over 10,000 meters, because you know how many pop. I don't want you to puppy says basically yes yes i don't oK, take care. I love you. I love you. Basically Video Mrs. But Mr. Well, I'll marry you. I'll marry Miss. Well, basically, I'm still this noise, just blooping. It just makes sense to me. There's no need to think about it because I know it will sound. But I'm getting more meaningful. Without being well. Without being well. I'm being put in my words, we say allowed to put my will myself in the way we should or the animal shoe. It's just perfect because you know, the storerooms allow me to want to fragment the system, get extra rooms. There's no fragmentation in the store rooms and it's still conversion to something there for me to go to if I want extra space. Who's business there are still commercial. Everyone gets a stirring and still commercial. Thank you guys. I got a family still room, a family store as well. OK, thank you guys. Alexa, stop.
