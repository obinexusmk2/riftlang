and I'm currently the council I was with uh recently uh thorough council has refused to give 
me an independent accommodation under the health and social care uh act of 2014. I've reinstated 
my rights to the service um but I've been met with delays and denials of um custo reassessments. 
Therefore, I test to proceeded. Therefore, I test to proceed to other councils. Um um M

currently inford IG50 EQ under the service heat care services. Uh this service provides um 
it's a care service but I'm trying to move on uh to independent living uh what is known as 
an independent uh accommodation uh or a house or or mansion if you guys prefer to give me a 
mansion because I'm really a word of a mansion. Uh you do pardon. Is this new on dark side? No. So you've

Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh. Oh. Okay. Sorry, madam. Okay, madam. Uh, one more thing. So, this is 
wrong number for that job. Okay. Uh, sorry, madam. I got the wrong number. I just got 
mixed up. Okay. Sorry, madam. Um, so madam. Uh, since you're in my admission right now, uh, the 
LCCU has to um, uh, try to find my money. Uh I've called the adult social care team for my careers 
act and my because the if I turn to 25 I will not be able to get my money uh as the bank I was with 
under new council uh which I believe was Monza was um was my bank uh the the children's bank uh 
by Oxfam uh the charity uh for new children uh with a little service for McMillan but you 
know did anything Mac uh Mcast support that is um I okay basically the LCCU has a duty to um 
to protect my money uh even though the service has closed. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That was in your 
account. They were due to put your money for up to 15 years under the FCS. 15 years. Oh, okay. Okay. 
15 years. Okay. 15. Sorry. 15 15. Okay. Sorry, madam. I need that money now. I've I've already 
I've already cuted the adult social care team. Unfortunately, they have not uh been uh 
able to comply uh with the standards and the dates met to issue me my service until the 
until the air service closed. So that's why I rang you guys. Uh cuz you know do you have your 
membership number? Um I I don't funny enough but I do have a letter. Um but you know I I rather 
someone call me back another time for it. But someone's actually pick up their phone and do 
their job for once in their life. But you know right now I'm in the garden. I'm eating food and 
I don't want to run upstairs to get a letter while I'm eating. It's no good for my health. I can do 
your find you like that. I have your surname. Uh O for Oscar. Yeah. K for kilo. Yeah. B for papa. 
Yeah. A for alpha. A for limo. Yeah. For alpha. And could you confirm your first 
name for me? My first name is Namji. Right. So I madam uh I you know I don't have my bank card 
with me at the moment but you know I do have my bank card but I don't have it set up on my phone. 
So the the the amount is 20 pound 2,00086 pence uh but this should be uh secure some uh 
assets um uh some stability for a little while um for a long while actually but but you 
know I don't want to say what we use a word of money for that's what I'm saying very 
skeptical uh as is uh the money issue I have um so um I don't know because they the the the 
council is meant to issue a check but the check never came or they never did and they didn't 
convince which and I don't and I don't know that your address no that's one 
of my old residents uh that's uh someone called that we have on the system 
that would check yes is that mad madam madam madam check madam madam madam please please 
please uh is that in reham or reign and dagnham Where is that? Is that in Reham? 
Ream Dagnum SX. SX in Tbury. Essex. Ilford. Essex. Ilford. Madam, 
I'm not familiar with this address. I'm I'm not familiar. But you know, since 
it's in madam, please please no mistakes. Um, I don't know who who who done this, but 
I don't know how uh but this is not like this is not something that's familiar with me. Uh, 
Glenn was garden. I do know where the place is, but I didn't send it to this address. It's kind 
of weird. What's there? Maybe it's where the Oh, yes, I did it. I believe maybe Hello, how are 
you? Maybe it's where the uh maybe it's where the uh uh uh adult social care team is uh for the 
but but I don't know. I I don't really know cuz this this is Glenn with regard. It's like a random 
uh it's not even under like the the the the health uh office uh of the system. So madam I I would 
like um I I would need to say to the the current residents uh you know if possible but for me to do 
that I would need to see um proof of ID. Yes. Uh yes proof of ID. Do you mean passport? What kind 
of uh driver's license? What do you need from me? You are you me and me. Okay. Whoever's license. 
Yeah. Uh, one second. I'm writing down birth certificates or and sorry birth certificate. 
I'm writing it down. And uh and passport and or passport and uh and proof of address or residence 
residence. Uh proof of residence. I call it, you know, I don't prefer the word address because 
I prefer the word residence because, you know, it's the same thing. But residence means you 
you stay in a temporary. Address means you own that. It's where you go to for your house. So, 
yeah. Yeah. It's like it's like a difference, a distinction, actually. Uh, proof of 
address. Okay. Uh, can I have the email, please? Yes. It's H A H H A H M A 
D M A D at pks at pks-l.com-l.com h ah uh at ha mad at pks-l.com you guys should 
stop using a URL encoders characters you know you're like it says you know you know I 
don't think you understand this but this is not URL safe anyway basically I'm stating 
that um the PK I'm not being read I think I should change it because I'm misstating the the 
vulnerability basically this some this is like um a dash is a hyphen but you know the the 
character set the computer um like if you write just normal characters the computer has like 
a set bytes to allocate for that uh but you know you have like a dash an underscore uh a bracket 
or something that's non URL safe like a web URL uh if you if you have the end point as you can go 
if you use this like if use as PKL as as a website you know which you are using and someone gets 
this um code they can there's something called a buffer attack uh you know to use the basically 
the the the on the dash you know I think they should change it basically the dash you can kind 
of store more bytes any email it's not my Yeah yeah yeah I'm just trying to I'm just explaining 
the vulnerability of this using this kind of um URL encoded emails but you know that's why I see 
this end to end yes madam madam what is madam M madam mad madam madam I know it's anti cryptos but 
that's when you get into your information but I'm saying when you expose whether for example if you 
send me say I got this email here but you know it goes to a website and I click on the website and 
it's con easy email to attach to that website it is the same thing that's going to happen because 
the exploit allows you to reroute the whatever the the the the mapping was of the schema because 
you know the the thing is that the the encryption wouldn't really matter because it encrypts just 
because the email is already sent with that uh malformed uh URL that can be broken because 
the the character set is not normalized because you need something called canonical normalization. 
So the basically I'm saying to you when you have a website you're going to have like try to have a 
a standard schema of so people can not enter by um having some kind of um code that's officated uh 
based on buffer techniques buffer stack overflow and over because the thing about this uh you 
understand what I'm saying but you know I'm being I think I'm being too much but the dash or 
the minus or those dot all the special characters are are there for um computational use you know 
they're there to do operations because you know the star is like a a star sign but when you 
um it's like a multiply sign uh but the the characters are just letters you know the that's 
the encoder so this can be like a minus you know I'm not joking to you in a computer program you 
can change the meaning you can can you can have the because you know that's saying that it's 
actually damage of the system and I guys you know it's 2025 I don't explain how buffer attacks 
and uh and sanitization works uh of um you know sanitation is like the the trimmenting of this 
uh information but you I think I I think I'm just talking to someone that don't really know but 
you know this this thing can be treated like a minus in a in a program a calculator you know 
you know that's what I'm saying this a Python you don't you think it's nothing you think it's 
nothing but when you actually get to the computer why they use why the inputs are used in the way 
they are you you start to see why I mean yeah I get where you're coming from okay please I I want 
this fixed just for my man just just for just for the everyone's sake that I want to give if you 
get onto our Yes, our team like I said we are a firm over millions of people across the world. 
Yes. Madam madam madam I know your firm now I disclose that uh vulnerability please someone 
just at least change the the the domain name to to something that that's URL safe you know someone 
just try to take the initiative and like uh saying we're going to change our emails. I can I know I'm 
kind of scared. Yes. Yes. you know they you know I think they know I think they service basically 
they don't work in security background I I have I have a strong security background uh but you know 
I I I don't want to uh buff but I mean I do know how to get into systems but I don't have to get 
out safely you know it's kind of weird because you know it's like you know you get yourself 
in you have to get yourself out you see you see cuz you know if you get if you don't get out 
safely your the police can come to your door you get what I'm saying that's why don't risk it for 
the biscuit I know that yeah yeah yeah anyway Uh, that's what I'm saying to you. Uh, okay. Have 
a lovely day, madam. I wish you all the best. Okay. You, too. Okay. Thank you.
