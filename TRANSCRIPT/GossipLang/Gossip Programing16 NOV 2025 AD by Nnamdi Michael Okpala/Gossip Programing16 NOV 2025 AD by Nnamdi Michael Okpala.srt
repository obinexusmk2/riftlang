00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,490
(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Okay, so basically this is not recording, my

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,190
audacity is recording, three minutes on this, everything

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,750
is recording, it's going to be fine.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,610
Okay, now, basically guys, this video is very

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,350
important to me.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,770
It's the most first polyglot of networking programming

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,670
language.

8
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,570
The architecture has infrastructure compliance, structure by design,

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,070
which is the minimum principle of the Gaussian

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,690
ecosystem.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,549
So basically, we've got to have this thing,

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,830
it's called the Rifters Way, which is the

13
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,510
manifesto of the Rifters programming language.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,770
The gossip.gossi programming language, which is the

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,810
word for polyglot, networking, architectural, or programming language.

16
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,050
It's not assembly, because assembly is an architectural

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,730
language, but it's the gossi language, it's a

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,330
gossi.

19
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,870
So basically, this is just the Rifters manifesto.

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,550
It's basically the principles of the guiding infrastructure

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,610
for something called the Rif, which is a

22
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,310
regular expression, a bidirectional system, where you use

23
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,610
regular expression to create tokens and parsers, etc.

24
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,230
If you want to go to my riftheyoutube

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,330
.com slash oblankers playlist, you'll see how it

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,190
aligns with the overview.

27
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,810
But I'm going to develop a rift and

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,290
gossi lang.

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,370
The rift is just a part of the

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,890
rift ecosystem, which is a tool for matching

31
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:31,290
systems, for tokenizer, for systems.

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,570
Rift is a tool, it's part of the

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,430
tool chain, to use something called an R

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,810
syntax, a regular expression.

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,930
So you have like an R character single

36
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,590
quote, like an RC, or RX, matching like

37
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,810
a character set of a regular expression.

38
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,470
Or like an R double quote in C,

39
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,270
C11, C19, C19, C16, C21.

40
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,630
It doesn't matter, but rift is a flexible

41
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,110
translator.

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,450
It's meant to compete with YAC, with alignment

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,070
with objectives, like, you know, parting tokens across

44
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,810
public good infrastructures.

45
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,310
VM 1 has got hybrid and public good

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,650
systems.

47
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,430
Basically, this is just Rifters way.

48
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,970
I'm going to explain to you, like, you

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,010
know, this I want you guys to remember.

50
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,990
And I've got my notes already, so I

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,470
want you guys to really engrave into your

52
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,230
souls, okay.

53
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,010
So basically, this is called rift.

54
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,430
The rift is way.

55
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,570
So basically, this is the disc of Python.

56
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,010
You know, when you type Python, or .she,

57
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,350
in the terminal, you type in Python, .she,

58
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,510
import this.

59
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,510
You see the Python one.

60
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,730
But this is the rift one.

61
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,970
You're going to see it, basically.

62
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,310
Let me just give you an example here.

63
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,470
So here on the back of my terminal,

64
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,030
here, so let me just try to do

65
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,270
this.

66
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,410
So I'm on my terminal.

67
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,250
I type in Python.

68
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,090
So basically, I'm going to go to Python.

69
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,030
.she, that means compile power, import this.

70
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:47,890
Okay.

71
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,170
This is called a zen of Python.

72
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,530
Now, the zen of Python is the how

73
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,350
it should, how the Python standard should work,

74
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,390
you know, for people who are new to

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,650
Python or to Python.

76
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,710
This is zen of Python by team Ben

77
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,730
Peters, you know.

78
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,210
So this is what the Python one is.

79
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,150
But this is the zen, the beauty, the

80
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,610
zen simplicity of Python.

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,430
Beauty is better than ugly.

82
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,850
Explicit is better than implicit, you know.

83
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,190
But these have a deep meaning for the

84
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,990
ecosystem, for the fandom, for the people, for

85
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,330
the Pythonistas and the Pythonias.

86
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,390
You know, because, you know, if you break

87
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,650
your philosophy of this, your code is not

88
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,830
working, something like that.

89
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,110
And you don't have to open the whole

90
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,950
specification, everything, you know.

91
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,630
This is what the Python system really is.

92
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,950
But I'm not going to talk about the

93
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:31,310
disc of Python.

94
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,310
I'm going to talk about the Python math

95
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:34,570
one.

96
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,990
I'm going to go to the scene two.

97
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Here.

98
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,510
So we've got the Riftless way.

99
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,210
Now, this is for the Riftful chain.

100
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,790
So basically, import disc, not data.

101
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,350
Okay.

102
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,290
Now, the disc is memory, the structure, the

103
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:47,650
logic.

104
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,150
And not the logic, you know, the logic,

105
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,090
you know, how the system works, the models,

106
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,370
you know, the full-throat models, the error

107
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,490
correct protocol, the disc, not the data.

108
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,690
Not the stream of bytes, not the tokens,

109
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,910
you know, you know, the structure you're representing.

110
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,810
Using sparse graph, or sparse data, sparse, or

111
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,890
sparse byte path that's pipelatted graph with K

112
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,030
and N clustering, you know.

113
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,090
It won't be really formal.

114
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,890
Because sparse means there's any way you can

115
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,790
do it, model it, to get that result.

116
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:17,610
The model infrastructure, the struct, the pattern, the

117
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,570
struct in C, the cloud looping across, based

118
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,230
on verb noun modelling, that's the naming conversion,

119
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,890
you know.

120
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,470
It refers to the state of the machine,

121
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,450
the state, you know, the colour of the

122
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,630
state of the machine, the weightless of the

123
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,090
machine, using observer to consume a model, you

124
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,230
know.

125
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,970
How the machine sees the state, you know,

126
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,990
and the development of preservation, the pause and

127
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,490
resuming, the capacity of port to the frontend.

128
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,530
When you run import disc, you're not loading

129
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:40,990
files, guys.

130
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,030
You're restoring the context, you know, the context

131
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,210
of the system.

132
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,850
You know, it's basically a schema, like, you

133
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,470
know, a schema to restore context.

134
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,370
Every time, every time a programme ends in

135
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,290
return, you return.

136
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,970
Input disc helps you resume your extension, you

137
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,430
know.

138
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:57,810
Statement, expression, evaluation.

139
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,070
Statement, statement can be true or false.

140
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,350
Boolean evaluation.

141
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,070
True or false.

142
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,010
Statement, solution, or false.

143
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,230
Expression is true or false, or can express

144
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:08,530
a value, like a number or something, like

145
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,990
an object, a model, a structure, an intent,

146
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,330
you know, the intent, why the purpose of

147
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:12,670
doing that.

148
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,970
Now, guys, guys, guys, this is beautiful, guys.

149
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,090
I want you guys to guide you through,

150
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,570
guys, the ripper's way, you know.

151
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,510
This is just the first one.

152
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,730
Now, let the bytecode hear what the human

153
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,930
couldn't say, you know, you know, sometimes we

154
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,150
don't know what we can't do, we want

155
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,050
to do, you know, we want to do,

156
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,590
you know, we'll just try to code the

157
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,090
mofiber product, we don't know how to solve

158
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,470
it, you know.

159
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,430
Now, the bytecode is the core machine, you

160
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,750
know, it didn't go to analytics, you know,

161
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,870
you look at the bytecode, like the assembly

162
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,390
instructions, the doctors, and see how the system

163
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,190
meets in somatic context, you know, you know.

164
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,810
Threshold compilers often mean away, you don't optimise

165
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,370
any meaning, basically, it's about you human-centric,

166
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,030
you're the programmer or the AI system, about

167
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,410
you, the human intent, why you wrote that

168
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,630
code, you know, it doesn't matter about good

169
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,170
or evil, you know, is it good or

170
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,990
evil, does it not work against you in

171
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,390
the long run, you know, and you're going

172
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,090
to have to roll back many updates, you

173
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,270
know, allowing bytecode to reflect, but expression, expression

174
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,770
of intent, you know, your intent, what do

175
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,790
you want to do, and the rifters works

176
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,130
forward.

177
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,730
Now, the rifter works forward means, you know,

178
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,690
you're a rifter, you know, you're the, I'm

179
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,310
basically go to rift, test, r-f-i

180
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,550
-t-t-e-s, the rifter testing library,

181
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,050
you know, you can test rift expressions, now

182
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,830
you've got rift, rift, rift is like, for

183
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,010
example, you've got, what else, go to rift,

184
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,190
r-f-i-t, which is the patimacha,

185
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,370
then you've got the rift test, the testing

186
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,930
patimacha, you know, then you've got the other

187
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,450
ones, like rift, rift, rift is a flexible

188
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,470
regulation as firmware, on github.com slash ob

189
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,310
-nexis, rift-raff, etc, etc, you know, this

190
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,770
is a rift tool change, you know, now

191
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,550
rift-raff is for production, well, rift-raff,

192
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,930
rift-raff, you know, things that rift are

193
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,510
essentially you can use when a client, so

194
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,910
match the library systems, you know, it's about

195
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,850
positive systems that are coherent, you know, basically,

196
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,570
the rift, the riftal walks through, you know,

197
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,990
a thread of yarn, my yarn book, the

198
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,870
riftal walks forward like a thread to a

199
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,790
pin, a pin to a pin, you know,

200
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,670
that's not a, that's not metaphoric, that's, oh,

201
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,550
that's quite literal, you know, like, you know,

202
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,890
I take a thread of a yarn and

203
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,150
I'm trying to pin it to something, have

204
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,170
an objective, I have a goal, you know,

205
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,670
I want to do something, you know, I

206
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,130
have a one, I'm doing something to write,

207
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,350
you know, a thread is like a, basically,

208
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,230
you are certified with thread, a thread is

209
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,990
both a process and a story, so every

210
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,030
thread you pin, you know, you pin a

211
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,530
process, but that process is now part of

212
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,690
an ID, PID file, PID.log, you know,

213
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,470
and then when you pin that thread, your

214
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,950
strainer process, you know, you're removing that observer

215
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,070
bubble or the consumer bubble, you know, and

216
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,830
then you are now exposing it to danger,

217
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,890
you know, the rift doesn't think you look

218
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,010
back and it's unnecessary, they move forward with

219
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,890
an intention structure, you know, and then we

220
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,230
have one pass, sorry, this is my thing,

221
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,630
one pass, oh, this is just not pin,

222
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,490
one pass, no, okay, one pass, no recursion,

223
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,250
to recurse is to break the weave, you

224
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,670
know, so every time you've woven a thread,

225
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,050
you know, you don't go back, you don't

226
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,730
know pin a thread, you know, basically single

227
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,170
pass, this is a single pass compiler, you

228
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,950
know, it doesn't go through many phases, you

229
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,090
know, it seems to be minimal and optimal

230
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,330
for the human in the pipeline structure, you

231
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,290
don't have to get a bloated system to

232
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,710
build on top of it, you know, it

233
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,130
doesn't contain stability because, you know, you want

234
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,530
basically, you have one pass, one time to

235
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,370
do something, you have nothing to break it,

236
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,669
you know, you don't have anything, instead of

237
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,990
your structure-related, no looped, you know, complete

238
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,470
on top of the directed by path of

239
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,830
drag resolution, which I'll come back to later,

240
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,630
but you know, basically, if you go to

241
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,050
github.com, which should be here, if I've

242
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,590
opened it correctly, yes, this is something called

243
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,690
a semantic region X, this is about works

244
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:08,990
on a bidirectional mapping of layers of, you

245
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,930
know, something called a by-path that's a

246
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,610
dag grife, you know, the thing about this

247
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,250
by-path is a mode of consciousness, you

248
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,830
know, it's a mode of consciousness, I won't

249
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,690
say to you, this conscious model is very

250
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,730
coherent, it works for you and everyone else,

251
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,130
you know, this is server X, but you've

252
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,010
got a rust server X, but you know,

253
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,890
I'm gonna start reading from here, yeah, so

254
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,010
go like, it's for governance, you know, so

255
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,210
the by-path, wait, I'm just trying to

256
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,330
hear, so basically, in Ghostland, we have something

257
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,190
called an actor model and a witnessing model,

258
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,630
you know, now actor is an actuator, you

259
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,550
know, the accent is on behalf, you know,

260
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,530
it's axe on its own intent, you know,

261
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,370
the accent, no student expression is intent, but

262
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,710
you know, it's not enough for it to

263
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,550
do it to itself, so basically, Ghostman called

264
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,630
a by-path, resolution, so if you remember

265
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,390
my by-informatics repository, you got a by

266
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,250
-path, you know, when you have an upload,

267
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,430
you can use a, I'm just trying to

268
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:10,270
get this done, yes, basically, so what's the

269
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,110
motivation in X versus like, you know, mapping

270
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,050
of structures or by-paths, graphs or KNN

271
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,130
clusters or data, then you go to Hamiltonian,

272
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,150
Hamiltonian graph is the dead fresh search, three

273
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,670
first and last by-path infrastructure, that's the

274
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,570
first thing, that's the stack, now we go

275
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,570
to the stack, the stack goes one way,

276
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,510
you know, and then you go to the

277
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,630
queue, the queue is the first in, first

278
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,270
out of the structure, you know, if you

279
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,050
want to go to the bio informatics, you

280
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,170
can bio informatics, which is like the subset

281
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,350
of structural information, that structures means the structure

282
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,450
of the substitution, you can go to VVP,

283
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,930
which has a vision, VVP, which stands for

284
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,030
the MVP, you can go to sparse exits,

285
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,530
you can go to, you can run this

286
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,730
file called Hamiltonian sync functor main, you can

287
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,830
run this file python, just start with python,

288
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,690
but you know, this is sync, you can

289
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:03,510
sync 100% of the Hamiltonian and then

290
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,250
the third FI, hello, and FI for the

291
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,050
reason bio informatics, and you get one more

292
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,950
with server X, which is like a by

293
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:12,030
-path tag, so basically, get like a PLP,

294
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,610
a modular layer, so it's an observer called

295
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,610
muscle model, and basically, if the Hamiltonian algorithm

296
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,350
is used to first in, it's come out

297
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,570
last, so basically, it's used for uploading, you

298
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,810
know, the first in to all you put

299
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,250
comes out last, or isn't a stack, then

300
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,590
the other one, the Elorian one, Elorian cycles,

301
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,610
or the W, is using FOI first in

302
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,970
first out to download the data over the

303
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,350
server, this is not good enough, so you

304
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,510
have a hundred one, so basically, you go

305
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,150
live, you got to have a node, which

306
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,290
is like a little by-path code for

307
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,870
you, a local to your remote repository, because

308
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,950
you know, you're using the smarty version X

309
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,630
on the, on the github.com, I'm sorry,

310
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,270
on the HTTPS R.OBNXS.org, you know,

311
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,270
the bypass relationship, you know, you have your

312
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,830
own channel, you speak to your own channel,

313
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,630
or by-path channel, so basically, you put

314
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,610
your channel, or your local channel, you didn't

315
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,310
have your remote channel, for me, I have

316
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,870
my OBNXS Namdi account, that's my new channel,

317
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,590
and I can put my local repository, my

318
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,850
computer, to my remote repository, and then push

319
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,510
it to the world, you can upload and

320
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,390
download, you know, based on my preference, you

321
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,550
know, basically, it's not fragmented, because you know,

322
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,230
I have my Hamiltonian, I don't, I don't

323
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,190
upload to the world, if I don't push

324
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,590
my remote, if I don't release my remote,

325
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,790
you know, I wish like my remote repository,

326
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,170
but this is the, this is the Python

327
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,570
code here, Hamiltonian sync functor, now, basically, input

328
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,550
is the part, you know, this is like

329
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,070
the functor notation here, so, Python sync is

330
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,910
basically syncing the operations in Hamiltonian, and you

331
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,990
know, which are, which are just ways to

332
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,510
transfer the graphs, the graph to the structures,

333
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,710
you know, the goal of semantic version is

334
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,150
to map a major minor patch, since, symbolically,

335
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,310
and literally, to semantic version X, LTS, LTS,

336
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,350
or stable model, legacy, and have experimental, using

337
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,350
monogot, which is like one ecosystem, one polyglot,

338
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,110
one ecosystem, like Python, PyPy, brass, packaged cargo

339
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,570
systems, or like a C corner, you know,

340
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,630
one system, hybrid, you know, shared, shared across

341
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,370
all the infrastructures, recommended, things that are really

342
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,270
fragmented, but didn't get them better, based on

343
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,110
good, ruined adaptor patterns, and you get polyglots,

344
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,410
polyglot infrastructures, talk to any language, any library,

345
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,170
you know, that legacy-lang is the world

346
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,050
-source polygraph language, okay, now, back to the

347
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,470
reason that working as a key principle, so,

348
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,190
see that then, have I done the thing?

349
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,150
I saw that it's gonna crash, okay, let

350
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,450
me just unplug it, it should not crash,

351
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:51,090
okay, wait for it, wait for it, it

352
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,830
didn't crash, okay, it should not crash, you

353
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,310
know, okay, I open this one, now, so,

354
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,790
we got this, each breath, took it in

355
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,650
a breath, each precious truth, you know, basically,

356
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,410
the tokens are, like, can I say just

357
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,150
to start breathing, you know, like, you know,

358
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,770
when you have a token, you're speaking words,

359
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,470
trying to make words, so, you shouldn't speak

360
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,750
your breathing, you should, each token carries a

361
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,170
semantic word, you know, what I'm trying to

362
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,630
say, not just syntax, you know, the structure,

363
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,990
you know, that's why Gussie is a tokenizer,

364
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,410
to favour prefix, to make clear intention, tokens

365
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,550
are not part of units, they express decision,

366
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,390
you know, because this is polyglot, it's talking

367
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,310
to a lot of languages, you know, not

368
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,130
talking to any, just one language, you have

369
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,570
to understand why you're breathing, even, why you're

370
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,370
uttering a, a tone, a token, in a

371
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,510
tone, in one dialect, you know, ES2s are

372
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,010
not roots, but, I'm not true, it's by

373
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,870
root of intention, so, basically, this is, like,

374
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,830
the standard of token type, token value to

375
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,450
come in, more formally, phenomological or genonomological, which

376
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,110
means, like, the purpose of talk to the

377
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,470
world, doing something, and the structure, the genome,

378
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,790
of a makeup, or to the model, to

379
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,810
this past structures to do that, you know,

380
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,770
that's what it is, in Gussie language, the

381
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,910
ES2s don't pass the trees, there's the intense

382
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,150
types of values every day, so to be

383
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,230
seen, they ensure, this ensures the reflection of

384
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,170
programmer's choice, you know, the ES2s, how you

385
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,010
want to represent your information, how the system

386
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,070
stands, the difference between a Python ES2, Python

387
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,190
interpreter, you know, bytecode interpreter language, and a

388
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,830
C compound, or Russian compiler language, all drivers

389
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,470
are bound, not all binds are drivers, you

390
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,090
know, basically, not all, relationships are functions that

391
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,590
are not returned, they remain the whole, the

392
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,590
bind, you know, relationships are functions, that's what

393
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,430
that means, but I didn't put that there,

394
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,850
so the relationships are functions, you know, you

395
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,650
don't need to map, you don't need to

396
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,810
return an output, you know, into a decision,

397
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,230
to resolve anything with a DAG, or byte

398
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,530
DAG, or bipartite DAG, you know, the bind

399
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,130
behaviour, rather than computing, basically, to resolve the

400
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,690
system, your burden, you know, in a cycling

401
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,790
way, without, you know, continuous IOL, without giving

402
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,330
you a method to execute it, you know,

403
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,170
it's like a server just observing itself and

404
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,950
then fix its own errors, you know, because,

405
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,650
you know, it knows how to track its

406
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,210
own problems, okay, my maths is low now,

407
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,850
okay, all drivers are, all binds are drivers,

408
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,710
not drivers are binds, binding refers to attaching

409
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,150
functionality to data, you know, you know, drivers

410
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,670
are forcible of the binding, like USB interface,

411
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,410
or gosilab, polygon models, you know, some attach

412
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,810
automatically, some are, some are totally bounded, some

413
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,430
drivers behave externally, so basically, anything that drives

414
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,810
logic, you know, is predictable, you know, you

415
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,930
have to, you know, you can discuss everything

416
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,170
like binds, it's just a mapping, so you

417
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,870
don't need to execute it, you know, you

418
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,070
don't need to execute it, you just have

419
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,650
to, let's not just interface it, you know,

420
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,810
because it doesn't need to be hardware, you

421
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,550
know, it's just, it's just mapped, you know,

422
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,890
and gosilab, we don't bind our fear, we

423
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,410
bind out of care, like, hands to, you

424
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,750
know, and the cosy labs, which are probably,

425
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,350
probably gosilab, we do not bind our fear,

426
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,730
you know, we don't panic, you know, we

427
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,810
bind or to fix our code quickly, we

428
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,470
basically, we're not bureaucrats, but these are anti

429
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,790
-breaker systems, you know, we're trying to bind

430
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,650
out of care, you know, like our hands

431
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,069
are doing, you know, we hear the one

432
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,510
using the device, you know, it reminds me

433
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,390
of my treatment machine, you know, if I

434
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,069
try to fix that treatment machine, you know,

435
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,869
basically the cosy language, like, you know, I

436
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:14,050
was living on a machine, and I decided

437
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,470
not to use it because it wasn't quite

438
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,950
safe, you know, then I started this project,

439
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,530
because cosy language is a very safe language,

440
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,190
you know, it's 100% perfect, you know,

441
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,109
you just, there's no error, don't panic anything,

442
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,530
and how that works is because you bubble

443
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,570
all the errors to where the error came

444
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,850
from, you know, you don't propagate any errors,

445
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,650
you know, all the errors go upstream to

446
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,990
the, like, events, probably, and then, and the

447
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,410
observers, they track the errors through the programme

448
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,750
with a tag, you know, this that means

449
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,490
resolve and don't, you know, and this you

450
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,450
want to see, and then you don't, because,

451
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,150
you know, it's a, it's a by-path

452
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,830
of, it works just like all the angles

453
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,690
of the errors, like a ring topology system,

454
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,010
you know, the goal of the by-path

455
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,490
model is to resolve the errors in the

456
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,590
gossip lab, you know, which is developing the

457
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,150
gossip lab, which is gochub.com, GOSI labs,

458
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,610
it's also gossip languages in our labs, so

459
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,890
basically you have ordered this here, and then

460
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,830
you get to plan you now, you know,

461
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,610
so like, the P2 gossip, the PYG gossip,

462
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,190
the system is connected to gossip language, you

463
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:24,890
know, to do something, but they're just for,

464
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,110
you know, there is a schema to it,

465
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,770
basically, if you want, like, a PHP gossip

466
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,310
for some type, like a PHP gossip for

467
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,170
a PHP package, you know, but you can

468
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,370
use a PHP binding, which you can map,

469
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,010
you can use a PHP plug-in, which

470
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,470
is essentially of a binding to extend the

471
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,910
plug-in for the HD, which is for

472
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,270
each case in that PHP system, and then

473
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,810
you can get a PHP software domain kit,

474
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,330
you can get a PHP platform, different bucket,

475
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,390
or SDK, depending on the Windows, Linux, or

476
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,490
Macintosh systems, you know, depending on what the

477
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,910
things are really about, you know, it's joined

478
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,270
as a degradation between all the ecosystems, and

479
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,050
everything is deliberately binded, because you need it,

480
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,570
you don't even want it, you don't want

481
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,770
it there, you know, I mean basically, concur,

482
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,170
basically, you know, how Gosilang stuff was, you

483
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,710
know, it's about thread-safe, everything, Gosilang is

484
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,870
100% thread-safe, why is it 100

485
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,050
% thread-safe?

486
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,170
Because, you know, you don't, you don't, you

487
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,190
don't map into it, you don't need to

488
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,450
observe it, you can see the state of

489
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,190
your programme, and the big thing with concurrency,

490
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,030
and thread panics, you know, it's because they

491
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,570
are synchronous, you have to time them everything,

492
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,290
you have to, but you know, you don't,

493
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,610
you feel probably everything, that's frustration, you don't

494
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,870
even need to, if the source is the

495
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,550
error code, you know, you don't, you don't

496
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,450
resolve it with the wrong tag, you go

497
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,690
the wrong way, and you know, the big

498
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,070
thing with thread-safe is 100% thread

499
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,250
-safe means, like, you know, there's no risk

500
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,390
in concurrency, or parallelism, around two times, there's

501
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,090
no attacks, or lapping times, and how I

502
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,870
saw this, because literally, you know, you can

503
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,590
run this in a tag, you know, in

504
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,870
a bad head of a tag, but, you

505
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,230
know, you bubble up, you win at the

506
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,310
state, you observe the state, yes, because there's

507
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,370
no thread involved, even, there's no thread, you

508
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,250
know, everything is just a, like, you know,

509
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,750
a message passing, you know, basically, if I

510
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,430
send some data, or some, it's a message,

511
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,810
you know, that message is not, it fails,

512
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,050
it's not getting processed, you know, it failed,

513
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,190
and you can fix the process before you

514
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,870
can do it, because, you know, the data,

515
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,330
the stream of information, it's not, it's not

516
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,130
blocking thread, it's just locks, there's no panicking,

517
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,130
there's no, it's asynchronous locks, you know, it's

518
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,390
just time, it's just, you know, the message

519
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,230
is coherent enough, and the timing is, it's

520
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,950
past, because, you know, there's no, I'm saying

521
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,190
there's no thread issues there, because the sleeping

522
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,630
machine will have a lot of thread issues

523
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,330
because of locks, everything, and try to manage

524
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,810
two resources at a time, but it's not

525
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,510
easy to unlock one resource and use another

526
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,490
resource, you know, you know, it's just time

527
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,530
consuming, a lot of resources, so you just

528
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,090
crush all that money to do together, you

529
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,530
know, basically, how this works is based on

530
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,070
the model of the system here, I'm going

531
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,010
to give you now, so basically, you have

532
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,810
like a, like, you know, like a filmmaker's

533
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,610
token, it's like a, you know, filmmaker's memory,

534
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,750
which can be nil, new state, it just

535
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,930
means Iota state, which can be the default

536
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,910
state of that system, when it doesn't evolve,

537
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,770
you know, just like, nil means nothing, no

538
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,750
memory, no token type, no value, empty, so

539
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,490
basically, the nil type is a void pointer,

540
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,010
you see, it points to nothing, because it's

541
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,110
not into a pointer, you get it?

542
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,090
You know, so it's just, it's a waypoint

543
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,990
opportunity, the top type, no, it's void, means

544
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,790
that void data, no, void data means void

545
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,210
token, for focal token, void token, but that

546
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,910
token is not present, or some information is

547
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:42,950
present, or token value, token type, void token

548
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,430
type is like the type of the data,

549
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,170
and the type of the token, and the

550
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,510
type of token data, the data, the data,

551
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:51,470
the data, and then that token value, the

552
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,370
value of the data, the character, or the

553
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,990
string, or the, what they do, but, you

554
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,490
know, we, in our model, with the PLP

555
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,590
layer, the general type model, it's just, there's

556
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,170
no, there's no ambiguity in the structure of

557
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,590
the schema.

558
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,190
Now, the general type model is really important

559
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,750
here, for Gussie UML.

560
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,750
Now, the Gussie UML is very important, because

561
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,270
the Gussie UML is like, the UML layer

562
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,310
of the architecture, you know, we stay, we

563
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,730
listen, we compile both, we don't, we don't,

564
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,990
basically, the thing about this, is the Gussie

565
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,010
UML isn't like a planning diagram, but, you

566
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,750
know, every time I type a Gussie programme,

567
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,250
Gussie UML language, you know, I gossip with

568
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,130
something, I get to Gussie, like, you know,

569
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,850
I, I get tokens to me, but, you

570
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,250
know, I get the, the architectural blueprints, you

571
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:34,530
know, what I'm wanting, you know, I get

572
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,910
the structure to, or what the, biological system

573
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,330
looks like, you know, if I had it,

574
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,670
like, in silicon, you know, like, in the

575
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,790
architecture, you know, basically, when I type in

576
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,450
Gussie UML code, I get the, my goal

577
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,210
is to have this system, give me the

578
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,190
blueprint, why I type code, it would have

579
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,990
come to me then, you know.

580
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,850
So, when I export a code, I look

581
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:55,070
at my blueprint and say, oh, yes, yes,

582
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,750
this is what I modelled in my, in

583
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,690
my framework, this is what I got, unless

584
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,290
I can improve, you know, it's really new

585
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,610
to do this, but, you know, it's architectural

586
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,530
as infrastructure, so you can have the, like,

587
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,930
me, unless I'm building the architecture on the

588
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,670
evaluation layer, and I'm writing a programme, you

589
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,850
know, to call it autocross itself, if I

590
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,930
am trying to implement a healing artefact, but,

591
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:13,930
you know, I don't know about the system,

592
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,470
it's, it's based on, you know, execution, and,

593
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,750
you know, which is just this here, I'm

594
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,410
just trying to not take a picture here,

595
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,530
because it's, I've got five more minutes before

596
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,350
my things stop.

597
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,270
Diagram, the architecture is random access memory.

598
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,890
So, we've got, we've got the planning UML

599
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,550
diagram with architectural blueprints, the big document is

600
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,190
the silicon that maps to the infrastructure.

601
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,750
We are via bi-tactical position, and the

602
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,930
diagram is so much of vision as a

603
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,190
policy.

604
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,490
Now, the policy and the standard application and

605
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,210
everything that's implemented is just like a, like,

606
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,330
you know, a declarator, a declarator function, a

607
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,790
function that maps across all functions, you know,

608
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,550
with the functional frameworks, and gives up the

609
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,730
computational benefits of functional frameworks.

610
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,350
So, you're going to have that in place

611
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,690
to ensure that a segmentary is, a segmentation,

612
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,550
which is like a segmentary memory using, or

613
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,270
from magic memory.

614
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,950
It's kind of with the architecture, it's a

615
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,390
bi-tactical relationship, like, based on algorithmically, the

616
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,430
second three nodes, it's like, you know, the

617
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,330
three nodes for them.

618
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,850
So, basically, you've got, like, a phenology of

619
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,810
token type, token memory.

620
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,250
Look, basically, it's like a structure, basically, it's

621
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,090
like a two-bit, like, something with, like,

622
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,710
a struck colour.

623
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,710
Colour is 255 range, or 256.

624
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,850
If it's an unsigned integer, you know, but,

625
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,850
you know, that colour, 0 to 256, once

626
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,110
it's 125, it's a range of colours, but

627
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,810
that model of colour is going to be

628
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,690
used to do some architectural thing, like, you

629
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,010
know, if you want to, you know, if

630
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,410
you want, like, an RGB, like, to do

631
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,570
randomness and kind of like, even where you

632
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,770
see, where you get, or where you see,

633
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,030
what you mean by direction of pipeline.

634
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,070
But, you know, when I type the code,

635
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,870
I get the light from there, I get

636
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,090
the silicon resolution of the architecture.

637
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,890
So, it can be debugged, it can be

638
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,750
actually done, you know, if I'm not with

639
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,330
the system, you know.

640
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,770
So, basically, they don't see anything.

641
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,730
The architecture is very important for our system

642
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,450
to remain coherent, because, you know, we are

643
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,990
the ones, we are humans, we know computers.

644
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,510
Basically, the segment tree is the node that

645
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,390
it segmented.

646
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,530
It's a big segment, it's like a segment

647
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,450
of memory, a segment of a token, a

648
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,330
segment of a value, a data value, using,

649
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,030
you know, a segment section, like, you know,

650
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,610
a section of memory.

651
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,310
So, you can defrag yourself, you can de

652
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,310
-segment yourself, and you can go into your,

653
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,110
into your tree, which, like, your time, it

654
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,050
needs to run, which I used to ensure

655
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,870
that the system does what it does in

656
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,570
time, you know.

657
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,430
So, you can go into your tree node,

658
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:38,870
silver balancing node, you can measure its own

659
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,130
state.

660
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,950
27, most parameters, I'll have to stop by

661
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,490
here today.

662
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,750
But, the goal of this, I'm going to

663
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,590
show you the code in the next video,

664
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,550
but, you know, that I've not done today.

665
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,330
So, we've got the PRP's parse mode, and

666
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,730
the infrastructure is networking.

667
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,250
The computational geometry of the system that can

668
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:01,050
evolve, you know, we have NMS, NMS, Sibley

669
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,570
language model, and Sibley Amazon Atlas for sleep

670
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,310
handling systems.

671
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,110
Or, like, basically, you can try to, when

672
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,390
it's gone over, after my PhD, when it's

673
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,450
gone over in two years, after my PhD,

674
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,830
when it's language is complete, I'll try to

675
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,670
build my own sleep value machine with it.

676
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,150
You know, for myself, my sake, you know,

677
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,750
and I'll build, which is, you know, which

678
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,290
is not, which is 100% really safe.

679
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,250
And this consciousness, you know, conscientious plasma systems,

680
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,610
like, I think that, like, for system people,

681
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,970
or even for people who are conscious, you

682
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,450
know, I knew there were people who are,

683
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,130
who are conscious, and needed the system to

684
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,690
remain for them or call them in a

685
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:36,330
sleep to really, their own coherence state of

686
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,470
mind, of awareness while they sleep, so they

687
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,590
can be cautious, you know, like, you know,

688
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,550
put a mirror on for a child, it's

689
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,130
not good enough anymore.

690
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:42,890
So, that's what I'm saying, you know.

691
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,370
Based on physical architecture, you know, computational work.

692
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,910
So, basically, the goal is for this programme

693
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,770
language to remain coherent, okay, now, to nine

694
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,170
minutes, okay.

695
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,930
Now, this is with this way, but, you

696
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,090
know, we've got the one here.

697
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,470
We will stay, we'll listen, we'll compile while

698
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,930
it's gone, and we've got, that means the

699
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,910
gosilang are based on rift policies, but the

700
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,230
rift policies are just for a rift ecosystem,

701
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,130
so the gosilang is put on rift, so

702
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,230
basically, that's like, you know, the rift policy

703
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,490
is not introduced or anything.

704
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,430
No burnout, it's like a rift policy file,

705
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,190
and now, no burnout, no overclock, and no

706
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,870
just rhythm, you know, basically, it's about thinking

707
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,550
of the nexus linker, and it's showing that

708
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,730
in any link, links everything, which, you know,

709
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,490
the accesses are unbloated, you know, there's no

710
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,310
burnout in space and time.

711
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,910
We have an app, a rift app, promodoro

712
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,370
by promodoro, okay.

713
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,230
Goal, a goal, a breath, a push, a

714
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,710
rest, you know.

715
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,850
Two truck of philosophy, foundational truck, and aspiration

716
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,570
truck, you work with two truck of philosophy

717
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,250
all the time.

718
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,310
Okay, now, guys, my government stuff, I've got

719
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:43,590
a great time.

720
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,050
You don't need permission to breathe, need permission

721
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,210
to take a break, only to read, okay.

722
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,030
I'm going to collect a couple of videos

723
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,150
and I'll finish, thank you guys.

724
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,570
This is the medium article, let me stop

725
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,870
it now, three, two, one.

726
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,050
Three, two, one.

727
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,140
Okay.

728
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,070
Okay, it's done, this is done, this is

729
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:18,710
done now.

730
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,310
Okay, that's fine.

731
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,570
That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

732
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,590
Okay, it's not done.

733
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,920
Okay, this should be fine.
