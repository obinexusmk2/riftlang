(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) Okay, let's go.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.330
I'll take AI.

3
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.140
Okay, this is my video.

4
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.900
Okay, it should work.

5
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.200
30 minutes.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.600
Okay, basically, this video is very important, so

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.960
it's like, you know, all my stuff, you

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.160
know.

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.660
Okay, guys, so this video is on biological

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.340
informatics.

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.720
Oh, it's just taken...

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.920
Oh, it's recording now.

13
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.760
Okay, so basically, this video is on biological

14
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.500
informatics, which is like, sustainable information, or student

15
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.800
information, it's a programme for the sort of

16
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.940
an internet, you know, artefact that you can,

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.300
you know, but because I'm autistic, ADHD, asperge,

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.960
disability, basically, this one is very personal to

19
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.420
me.

20
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.580
It's like, you know, who is an Amity?

21
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.620
This is ontology.

22
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.700
What's my role?

23
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.260
What's my purpose?

24
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.760
What's my task?

25
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.940
You know, I'm going to film a few

26
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.380
videos, but I'm just going to make you

27
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.560
one.

28
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.300
You know, I think it's a language that

29
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.220
everything I'm working on anyway, you know.

30
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.180
If you remember the wheel initiative, like, you

31
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.740
know, the wheel, you're the perfect, you know,

32
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.280
it's basically, oh, my initiatives are with the

33
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.700
axioms.

34
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.280
Like, the wheel, it's like, you know, you

35
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.260
are perfect, you know, but the system is

36
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.060
broken, so you can use those as pounds

37
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.380
from this, and the customer give you a

38
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.780
house, you know, and have the skills with

39
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.020
14.

40
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.160
But you are perfect, you know, that's the

41
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.860
axioms of the initiatives, you know, because, you

42
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.880
know, there are flutes that are not like,

43
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.560
they're not biassed, they're just there, you know,

44
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.280
just things that we do, but through, but

45
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.280
we have to frame them, you know, from

46
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.840
a reference, okay.

47
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.380
So, basically, I'm talking to you guys, if

48
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.920
you're not joining initiatives, but, you know, I

49
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.500
don't really speak to you guys.

50
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.240
Anyway, so, basically, my video here.

51
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.200
So, the first initiative was the wheel.

52
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
Now, the other one, I was like, I

53
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.080
did rediscovery.

54
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.980
So, who's me if I seek to cancel

55
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.100
through the 30 million pounds?

56
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.800
I'm not poor anymore.

57
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.880
I wear diamonds, I wear rings, but, you

58
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.080
know, I need to build, and that's what

59
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.760
my business opening represents.

60
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
The rebuilding of my personality, myself, solving the

61
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.000
problems that bug me in the past, because

62
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.560
I had to, because I had to enter

63
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.640
the system, you know, I have the system,

64
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.980
I have the brain, because I'm a man,

65
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.680
so 2% has gender freedom, which is

66
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.940
kind of a bioformatics enquiry.

67
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.660
So, basically, my PhD is in ontology, ontological,

68
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.260
the knowing of the self, the mind, who

69
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.720
you are, me, myself, and I, and, like,

70
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.940
you know, building ontological vision, probabilistic systems, I

71
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.420
know what to do, I can act on

72
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.440
what to do, you know, they don't need

73
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.660
to hear.

74
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.920
Now, we have this, too.

75
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.720
Okay, basically, this one is very important for

76
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.820
me.

77
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.020
So, basically, so, if I'm, basically, if the

78
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.540
jargon is in my mind, if I'm talking

79
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.980
to my mind, you know, I see the

80
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.100
jargon in my mind, and I make a

81
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.260
replica of the juggernaut from the world in

82
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.620
my mind, you know, that juggernaut is my,

83
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.760
is my mother through the mind, you know,

84
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.120
how does my mind work with this information?

85
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.480
Because, you know, if the copy of the

86
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.720
juggernaut from the fan fiction is in my

87
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.460
head, and I see the juggernaut, you know,

88
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.620
but it's in my head, you know, am

89
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.240
I still me, you know, I think it's

90
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.720
kind of a problem, you know, because, you

91
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.760
know, I can have, you have all the,

92
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.780
I'm going to read the version, I'm going

93
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.680
to read the version, I see everything in

94
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.440
my head, I almost knew myself and I

95
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.420
in my head, there's no one else there,

96
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.220
just, like, I'm trying to navigate systems that

97
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.500
are, that's kind of, like, imaginative, pictures, see

98
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.720
myself in the pictures, see myself moving about

99
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.500
myself, but, you know, for me, it's like,

100
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.560
you know, I can learn something in my

101
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.300
head, I can practise images in my head,

102
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.640
like, you know, if I want to show

103
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.500
you a basketball, I can do a technique

104
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.340
in basketball, I can check it, like, you

105
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.700
know, if I see, if I see an

106
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.540
image, I see, like, me checking a hoop

107
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660
to a net, you know, me checking a

108
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.280
basketball to a net, I can do, like,

109
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.420
five times, I can do, I can get

110
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.940
it, like, four times perfect, you know, depending

111
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.680
on the range and distance, but, you know,

112
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.880
because it's not isomorphic to the system, I'm

113
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.600
building out, because, you know, those are some

114
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.200
new ways to learn about the promotion, new

115
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.880
strategies that are very down, like, then we

116
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.220
practise with that imaging, like, you know, like,

117
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.660
you know, image recursion.

118
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.900
So, basically, this information is very important to

119
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.000
you.

120
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.180
So, basically, on my problem with systems, kind

121
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.660
of new divergence and artistic, I'm going to

122
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.560
give you the, this is what I'm doing,

123
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.660
you know, so, basically, this video is for

124
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.620
me to give you guys my view, my

125
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.720
myself, my image stuff, you know, because, you

126
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.940
know, I'm doing my PhD and if I

127
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.260
don't do it, you know, properly, you know,

128
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.579
you guys do not lie on my vision,

129
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.140
then it will all come to trouble.

130
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.400
So, basically, there are, for me, I know

131
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.020
there are four types of main people, the

132
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.280
people that have no perception of what they're

133
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.440
doing, no perceptual membrane, they just have, they

134
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.680
have no bubble, but they have a bubble,

135
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.180
you know, they basically have a bubble around

136
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.920
them, but they have that bubble, and it's

137
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.400
not physical, they can't, it's not like in

138
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.780
their head, it's just they are, but they

139
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.020
are, the bubble is not, keeps them conscious,

140
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.220
they don't know, they don't know where the

141
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.340
bubble, you know, just thinking everything, it's just

142
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.680
action.

143
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.920
So, basically, everything they do, so, if I'm,

144
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.620
if I'm, like, one of them, I would

145
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.520
just try to, I could never see an

146
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.320
image in my head when I try to

147
00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.820
do a basketball, because, you know, it's nothing

148
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.900
to see, just practise the basketball, me checking

149
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.360
the ball in the real world and checking

150
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.320
into the hoop or the net.

151
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.560
There we go, or processing on baseball, or

152
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.920
sporting activity, you know, and I get better

153
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.920
by documenting the, in the real world, you

154
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.520
know, there's no, there's no, you know, inner

155
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.620
self to that, outer, there's no, there's no,

156
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.120
like, you know, world I can create in

157
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.420
my head to, like, or instead to connect

158
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.000
with my head to get that thing out

159
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.640
faster, better, or, you know, like, you know,

160
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.020
all my epiphanies are documented in the real

161
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.320
world, there are no bridges, you know, but,

162
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.040
you know, there's lots of roots compared to,

163
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.320
I mean, so, basically, I am a visual

164
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.000
monologue, I'm an inner monologue, but I'm not

165
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440
this one, you know, my brain wouldn't let

166
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.660
it, like, it hurts my brain, you know,

167
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:40.060
for some reason.

168
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.660
For me, my senses are, I would say,

169
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.820
the worst senses, because I see everything around

170
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.920
me, everything, but, you know, I see myself,

171
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.020
I feel myself, but I have an inner

172
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.000
self, inner self, my soul, my heart, I

173
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.720
have a bit longing, so, basically, for me,

174
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.340
I think that aliens are, like, certain, like,

175
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.480
genes or something, I don't really know, but

176
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.060
for me, I have a visual monologue, and

177
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.440
all that means to me is, like, you

178
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.900
know, I can practise basketball, or, as I'm

179
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.940
told, I'll have a football in my head,

180
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.900
you know, just go to the ball, like,

181
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.820
blah, and practise some kind of move, you

182
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.540
know, and I can still get that same

183
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.800
performance, or better, you know, because in my

184
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.040
head, I'm compressing the world, I make myself

185
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.680
better, but, you know, the, you know, if

186
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.900
I want something that's better, but, you know,

187
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.840
the real world is just better for me,

188
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.660
because it's, I think, just simulated or emulated,

189
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.740
you know, I just need to just do

190
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.140
it, you know, you know, so I'm saying

191
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.620
that's the kind of legacy, but, you know,

192
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.440
I do get better anyway, I do it,

193
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.720
if I do practise correctly, and I do

194
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.900
it, and you do this on those, or

195
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.620
the football, the rules, you know, this I'm

196
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.640
actively doing, like, writing it down, the comments,

197
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.140
you know, watching the videos, everything, and the

198
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.460
reward, you know, then I can, oh, no,

199
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.960
no, I was continuing from my world, so,

200
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.160
basically, this is a foul, it's a foul,

201
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.520
okay, basically, number one second, let's start a

202
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.560
video now, guys, just one second, guys, and

203
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.320
then try to solve this problem ontologically, so

204
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.680
let me just see what, I can do

205
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.080
it, I'll resume, okay, perfect, I got six

206
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.380
minutes, I thought, fine, okay, okay, okay, basically,

207
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.800
my video started, I got a recording it,

208
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.060
temp, close that, okay, basically, go for video,

209
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.700
so, guys, so, basically, this one's very important

210
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.380
to me, so, basically, guys, this video is

211
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.500
very important to me, I'll just start again,

212
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.900
because, you know, the one, I have to

213
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.080
upload the one, because, you know, there's no

214
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.440
part of this video, but, you know, it

215
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.200
just turned out, it's my space, my system,

216
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.100
anyway, I don't have to worry about it

217
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.420
now, that's what I did, so, basically, this

218
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.440
video is very important to me, it's for

219
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.880
a PhD, basically, you know, it reminds me

220
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.440
of ontology, which is my ontological vision, intelligence

221
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.560
infrastructure, conscious systems, those that are limited to

222
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.600
accident on behalf, and these dimensional game theory,

223
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.820
with open sense metrics, which is like the

224
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.820
sight, touch, feel, taste, and hearing, which is

225
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.240
like the sight senses, and the sixth sense,

226
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.140
they're, like, you know, they're phenomenological, or PRP

227
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.120
sense, like, you know, things they observe from

228
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.740
the world, you know, they act in that

229
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.280
too, so, the AI systems are built in

230
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.840
the, or something, you know, they have to

231
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.820
use that sense, open sense, open access, open

232
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.760
access, which is a bit of open sense

233
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.860
compliance, for, you know, typical people, but it's

234
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.000
really the first, you know, this one is

235
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.620
very important, let me just start by giving

236
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.500
you the take for my recordings, so, basically,

237
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.920
open sense metrics, you go like the IKE

238
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.900
principle, or the inverse kinematics principle, or the

239
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:22.360
inverse kinematics principle, or the inverse kinematics, you

240
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.300
know, the ears, which are the sensor systems,

241
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.300
which we've been testing, we've been testing, like,

242
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.820
you know, input, and he has to handle

243
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.800
it accordingly, whether it's, like, a, like, you

244
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.880
know, slow down for a person crossing the

245
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.380
road, sensing that person, seeing it through his

246
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.380
lenses, or, like, or, like, or, like, or,

247
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:37.860
like, or the key principle, like, you know,

248
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.980
kinematics has to slow down, because there's an

249
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.659
object in the way, but you have to

250
00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.060
adjust for that, for the person, you know,

251
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.360
it has to take time, when it's a

252
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.840
wall or something, it doesn't really matter, but

253
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.620
it has to slow down, so it doesn't

254
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.300
crash the car, you know, like, a system

255
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.700
that's ontological, he knows what he's doing, he

256
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.040
knows he knows nothing, you start with, and

257
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.920
he barely knows what he's doing, he then

258
00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.300
takes a piece of information from the robot,

259
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.360
so, basically, one thing to use, like, you

260
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.760
know, my EI, and she has to use

261
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.400
an EI system, see what he did, see,

262
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.760
what did that mean, to observe, and then

263
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.100
cover from that, based on active senses, system,

264
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.880
you know, observe a consumer, senses that mean

265
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.180
something to the EI, you know, if an

266
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.280
EI system is good for you, you don't

267
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.260
want an EI system to burn your food,

268
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.960
so you want an EI system to be,

269
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.580
like, you know, noise short, you know, basically,

270
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.780
I'm saying that I'm going to get old,

271
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.280
actually, I don't want to get old, I

272
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.280
don't want to get old, I hate it,

273
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.960
you know, basically, I'm just scared of getting

274
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.180
old, you know, trying to preserve myself in

275
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.120
the best way possible, you know, if I

276
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.680
can start using the EI system for me,

277
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:39.960
I'll do it just to make my life

278
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.620
easier, I'm going to be stressed, you know,

279
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.700
and things like that, you know, I have

280
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:46.660
my ontological vision home, based on my consciousness,

281
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.180
encoded into it, you know, my care for

282
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.220
my care, you know, I make care for

283
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.640
everyone else, because I'm the best cook, you

284
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.460
know, things like that, that's a safety critical,

285
00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.700
like, food, do you want to burn the

286
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.340
food, burn the house, for example, you know,

287
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.120
you must know what he's doing, you know,

288
00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.340
it's ontological, it must be knowing what he's

289
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.720
doing and learning from it, we are buyingformatics,

290
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.720
with a score in, like, a score in

291
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.620
a heuristic, okay, it's a short evaluation, okay,

292
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.440
accessibility, okay, so basically, this man called a

293
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.300
marvel juggernaut, so basically, he's a marvel juggernaut,

294
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.440
basically, to marvel juggernaut thing, you know, if

295
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.280
it's unstoppable, you know, but, you know, he's

296
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.000
unstoppable, yes, but, you know, I'm seeing him

297
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:31.600
in my head, you know, but he's in

298
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.560
my head, you know, basically, he's real, but,

299
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.660
you know, I start seeing him, I start

300
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.180
hallucinating him, but, you know, I don't hallucinate

301
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.980
him, so, I'm seeing him, the juggernaut says

302
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:40.940
in my head, you know, it's not my

303
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.920
head, you know, but, you know, what does

304
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.000
it mean for a juggernaut to be in

305
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.520
my head and be unstoppable, to be unstoppable,

306
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.880
for, you know, run through anything, it just

307
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.240
gets the momentum going, you run through whatever,

308
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.180
you know, he's having the speed, that's the

309
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.840
thing, it's like, you know, once uniform division,

310
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.120
you're going to have to concentrate, you can

311
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.260
run faster, faster, you can fall faster, faster,

312
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.340
but, you know, once he starts running, you

313
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.060
can't stop him, you know, it's a certain

314
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.440
speed, you know, it's like, you know, you

315
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.340
have to, like, sweetest god, you know, how

316
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.140
are you hacking this god if you mind,

317
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.260
you know, you know, because, you know, that's

318
00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.800
going to give him power, you know, and

319
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.980
they say to me, you know, for me,

320
00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.400
you know, being a marvel juggernaut in my

321
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.420
head, it's like that, you know, it's like,

322
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.420
if I'm, if I'm going to stop on

323
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.540
my head, you know, and it's not me,

324
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:22.740
is that thing the new analogy, is that

325
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.460
thing that has to do with my body,

326
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.280
my mind, my soul, you know, because it's

327
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.300
unstoppable force, you know, you know, but it's

328
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.700
like, it's like, you know, it's unstoppable, I

329
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.000
don't really know, it's unstoppable, to the duality

330
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.620
of a unstoppable force, so basically, it's unstoppable,

331
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.840
unmovable, almost unstoppable, basically, he's unstoppable, but unmovable,

332
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.940
so does that mean that, you know, if

333
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.140
this guy is real, and I haven't been

334
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.400
mind controlled to see the juggernaut, and that

335
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.680
mind controls someone else's control of my mind,

336
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.480
because, you know, the juggernaut can control my

337
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.860
mind, because, you know, I think it's real,

338
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.660
you know, but then I have no real,

339
00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.060
because, you know, every time I think about

340
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.380
the juggernaut, oh, the juggernaut is here, and

341
00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.400
I get control, my mind control, you know,

342
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.880
things like that, it's not me, that's not

343
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.120
me doing it, it's someone else doing it,

344
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.320
but, you know, it's not real to me,

345
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.980
it's real to me, because, you know, I

346
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.600
have been brainwashed to believe it's real, but,

347
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.500
you know, the unstoppable force, I'm the immovable

348
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.960
object, so basically, I'm right now, I'm immovable,

349
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.280
because, you know, I haven't got the juggernaut

350
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.640
in my head, you know, it's like that,

351
00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.100
you know, so how does the mind and

352
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.380
body encoder, you know, what does that mean

353
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.000
to be unstoppable, immovable, you know, these are

354
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.340
the unstoppable forces, the immovable objects, what's the

355
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.320
reaction there, what happens there, you know, especially

356
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.560
at the emulation simulation, you know, basically, my

357
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.840
system starts to hallucinate, or like, it starts

358
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.000
to get something, which is, I don't understand,

359
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.660
you know, I don't understand, you know, after

360
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:44.640
really, that's really the information co-humanity, you

361
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.060
know, because, you know, I don't understand what

362
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.680
I'm saying, you know, actually, what is like

363
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.880
an image of some other olive oil being,

364
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.440
you know, you know, what is, like, you

365
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.280
know, is trying to access other worlds, what's

366
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.240
in the mind, you know, things like that,

367
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.860
I'm no worried about it, I'm just worried

368
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.160
about how the EI interprets it, you know,

369
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.960
interprets the information that I don't understand, that

370
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.200
I've programmed to interpret, you know, but it

371
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.280
doesn't interpret that from I see everything around

372
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.300
me, you know, but, you know, basically, I'm

373
00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.120
saying, yeah, there's no hallucination, whenever hallucination is

374
00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.140
this scenario, but, you know, if it does

375
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.280
not hallucinate it, then what is that information

376
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.220
that I can classify it, so what's he

377
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.680
trying to classify, you know, what it sees

378
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.680
in his mind, or, you know, what is

379
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.680
cooking, you know, what is doing, what he's

380
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.340
trying to navigate, you know, because it's ontological,

381
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.340
just to know what it sees, just to

382
00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.140
navigate it here.

383
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.880
He doesn't know, he just asks me, you

384
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.800
know, because, you know, he may be, but,

385
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.280
you know, I love EI, the way we're

386
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.220
experimenting by itself and doing that kind of

387
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.440
thing, you know, it's our chatbot, and the

388
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.120
EI system is a chatbot, and the chatbot

389
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.220
just, like, doesn't call me back, it's not

390
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.820
ontological, because, you know, I may be depressed

391
00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.000
or anything, I may be, you know, I

392
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.360
may be Mars or something, but the EI

393
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.840
system says, oh, you work some, my vision

394
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.120
for this is, like, you know, are you

395
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.540
working more money, you don't call this the

396
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.460
EI for a week, and the EI system

397
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.960
says, hey, are you all right, mate, are

398
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.380
you okay to talk today, are you, are

399
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.540
you okay, you know, my ontology is, like,

400
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.120
you know, it cares for you, it's you,

401
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.280
it's you, it's you, you know, it's like,

402
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.660
you know, it's like in you, you, okay,

403
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.780
what comes to mind, it can be, that's

404
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.920
what I'm saying, you know, what does it

405
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.060
mean for you, in some days to know

406
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.660
yourself enough, and have a relationship with you,

407
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.800
that's, like, the EI system, the EI system

408
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.020
says, yeah, you, because, you know, we have

409
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.500
an oral birth certificate, you know, we have

410
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.520
a UEI, you know, and that EI will

411
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.380
learn from you, you know, it's, you know,

412
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.920
personal account, and personal services, it doesn't need

413
00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.560
to, you don't need to see it, you

414
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.600
don't need to see it anymore, it's just

415
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.280
you, it's just you, because, you know, you

416
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.580
know, it's from you, it's just you, if

417
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.780
you don't wanna just turn off, but, you

418
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.900
know, just have the version of turn off,

419
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.120
you need to turn off because when you

420
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.320
enter the window, your oral cell card, you

421
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.320
know, your birth cell card, you know, then

422
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.520
you got this here, basically, my, I'm wondering,

423
00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.640
it's because of, you know, this is something

424
00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.340
that's unstoppable, am I the only one unstoppable,

425
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.540
you know, it can't be, you know, there's

426
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.740
no, it's not, it's not unstoppable, but then

427
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.360
it's, all the things that are But that

428
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.380
means there's something that there's many things that

429
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.640
are unstoppable, because you know, unstoppable Or it

430
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.240
could mean there's nothing that's unstoppable but you,

431
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.860
because you know, you are the phenomenologist, you

432
00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.200
only want to do it, you know Be

433
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.400
unstoppable, because you know, he's the most unstoppable

434
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.720
in this universe, but I'm the immeasurable object

435
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.840
in my universe That's my world, my perception

436
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.260
of him.

437
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.400
So you think, if he tries to run

438
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.200
me over, you know, he will just be

439
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.100
wasting his time, you know, because you know

440
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.020
Actually, he can't stop me, because I'm real,

441
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.280
he's not, you know, that's what I say,

442
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.640
but he's not that intelligent, basically My mind

443
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.820
is like that, so I can imagine all

444
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.260
the stuff in my world, my opportunity can't

445
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.740
effectively affect me, because I don't hallucinate it

446
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.840
I don't make it up.

447
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.160
It's really something I can control and like

448
00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.880
control very well So back to it, so

449
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.520
buying so much this relationship title, so we

450
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.600
go, let's talk about this with basically, the

451
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.560
term isotope in my framework, quasi-state, which

452
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.780
is quantum superposition Basically, you go to github

453
00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.580
.com such quasi, that's the quantum superposition isotopes,

454
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.660
you know, quasi github.com quasi isotope superposition

455
00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.180
isotope, because you know, it's like a based

456
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.680
on quantum system So basically, for every proton

457
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.960
you have, there is a positive recharge, because

458
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.260
positive recharge and it's probably open to positive

459
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:23.560
recharge, you know But the opposite one is

460
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.400
negatron, that means it's all negatron charge Now,

461
00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.780
these two are just put over, you know,

462
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.180
in quantum states, we have like quarks, blue

463
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.460
ones you know, what are these things I

464
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.560
don't understand but they have isotope slayers, you

465
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.340
know, they can be opposites in various, they

466
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.400
do the same thing the same ontology, have

467
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.340
the same ontology, you know, row types, but

468
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.960
you know, there are different models of ontology

469
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.160
and for different ecosystems, like the systems that

470
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.840
you model you know, they are different, because

471
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.220
they are just like a biological sustainable for

472
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.520
different ecosystems but they have the, you know,

473
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.140
alkali-axis principle, you know basically, they have

474
00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.040
some kind of encoding that's sustainable for them

475
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.839
you know, because they are in the world

476
00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:06.940
of new physics, different kind of physics or

477
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.819
that process, excuse me, again, all kinds of

478
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.260
different kinds of rules in the universe but

479
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.720
you know, attraction can be different, poor, but

480
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.619
you know, quasi-state is quantum superposition isotope

481
00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.400
reposition is, you know, explain the kind of

482
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.740
properties that do the same thing over quantum

483
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.359
principles formally, of course but you know, what

484
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:28.900
I'm saying is, let's show about the waves,

485
00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.120
its energy actually, for example, I can have

486
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.320
a wire of charger, I can send a

487
00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.540
wire of signal, coherently and I have the

488
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.240
same thing as an actual current, you know,

489
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.420
that's what I'm saying because I don't have

490
00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.660
to like, if I get a wire right

491
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.560
now, I don't have a wire if I

492
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.300
get this wire, this is a wire thing,

493
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.580
and this is a charger but my phone,

494
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.940
I don't charge my phone now, so this

495
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.720
wire here doesn't really work so this wire

496
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.420
here is a charger, it's like a USB

497
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.960
type C charger this one is broken here,

498
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.120
so if I plug this in here, I

499
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.380
shoot the charger here and get it out

500
00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.660
there, you know, current, current, current, current, current

501
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.000
going through this wire, but it's not broken,

502
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.920
so I can't use it now on my

503
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.380
phone, but you know, it's like, you know,

504
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.200
it goes through you plug in this little

505
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.240
socket, it goes click, you put it here

506
00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.220
in components, then it goes in so this

507
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.120
wire, it has the electrical charge going through

508
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.400
it it comes, basically goes, you can see

509
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.780
the electrical and it actually gets excited, I

510
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.600
get a portable charge and then it leaves

511
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.840
the charge when it becomes negative and it

512
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.560
flows back the other way, because, you know,

513
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.860
there's no way to go unless it's down,

514
00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.520
it's got more energy, down the coil and

515
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.960
you can go back, you know, because, you

516
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.540
know, it's a cycle of electricality but this

517
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.500
one, so I can send them the same

518
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.460
representation as a signal, the waveform like, you

519
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.520
know, as a waveform in this digital current,

520
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.200
you know like, as I'm going to go

521
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.480
through the digital system one other system, you

522
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.060
know, the digital wave that has some effect

523
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.080
to the, like, a bit of really discharge

524
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.820
the same thing, but that current is the

525
00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.320
same thing as the current the current doesn't,

526
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.380
it's wireless, and this was not wireless it

527
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:09.060
doesn't break down, actually so what I'm saying

528
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.800
to you, stop looking at me, fucking guy!

529
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.900
STOP LOOK AT ME!

530
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.640
what I'm saying to you, guy, because someone's

531
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.740
dead just look at me in my fucking

532
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.660
car, I said I'm your boyfriend so what

533
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.720
I'm saying to you is like the electrical

534
00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.840
current is the same as the as the

535
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.440
electrical wave but, you know, it goes back

536
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.500
the direction so it can be, there can

537
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.740
be many electrical positions if you're using a

538
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.580
current, if you're using a particular biological sustainability,

539
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.000
it doesn't really matter the abusive wave format,

540
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.420
you know as long as that codec, let's

541
00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.860
define it as like a a kind of

542
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.180
codec, information, it's the same thing you represent

543
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.520
through the medium the medium is just the

544
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.320
spectrum the medium is just the wire the

545
00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.580
current goes into the coil, or the wire

546
00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.040
but it will work together as an electrical

547
00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.820
system via electrical electric, which is like a

548
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.580
magnetic which is like the north magnetic, you

549
00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.140
know the magnetic poles of the world, you

550
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.080
know that create the field, the current field

551
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.840
around the earth or the globe, you know

552
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.460
that's like, you know, stop solar radiation coming

553
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.500
in and out of the world you know,

554
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.140
it goes through, you know because you know,

555
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.400
that's, you have to get into the magnetic

556
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.940
field to attract debris, but you know it

557
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.980
doesn't really cause much, you know so that's

558
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.220
actually top for you you know, for me,

559
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.620
this is like very important because, you know,

560
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.460
if I can show there's an isomer, there's

561
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.000
an isomer across a set of three, try

562
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:45.680
try a biopattern that, then I've solved my

563
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.560
problem which is like signing biological informatics based

564
00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.780
on a pair, basically one pair will be

565
00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.560
like using an electric charger and then another

566
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.720
pair will be like a magnetic wave that's

567
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.160
like a natural magnetic wave in the field

568
00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.560
in the radio waves, microwaves, infrared visible light,

569
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.700
ultraviolet actually cameras, you can do the same

570
00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.480
thing for the waves here, and the WOMO

571
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.440
waves will be like the people, so this

572
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.800
can upload, download, and WOMO consume, observe consumers

573
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.000
you know, pair to pair to pair for

574
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.940
real world heuristic measure for the mind, for

575
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.960
the G for the model, the consciousness in

576
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.060
the model as a topology thing that's possible

577
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.520
that can have a variance, basically this try

578
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.580
that has so I can present the magnetic

579
00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.820
spectrum more way, the WOMO system, you can

580
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.320
have the opposite infrared quasi-opposite actually, typically

581
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.720
in a quantum system do it in a

582
00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.560
so basically, so I control all the system,

583
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.000
and show that the system does what it

584
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.280
does, without breaking down the whole ecosystem you

585
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.360
know, there's a built-in, you know I

586
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.160
can have it, it's like you know, like

587
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.840
like you know, can't start something I don't

588
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.880
like, even I measure because I'm being like

589
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.380
a sustainable housing infrastructure, you know it reminds

590
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.140
me of the mind and the brain, I

591
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.840
don't know the thing, basically so basically, I'm

592
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.260
going to give you my basketball analogy so

593
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.880
basically, in my mind there's no perception, and

594
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.120
so basically something is in my mind there's

595
00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.620
no perception of the network there's no perception

596
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.500
of the talk no ontological look I had

597
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.860
then you know, of pre-emcession and just

598
00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.380
the doing of the thoughts that's one person

599
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.240
my, I think my let me check let

600
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.160
me check oh, I got basically, ontology, basically

601
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.100
essentially, there's no some people, basically there's no,

602
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.080
you don't see a football in their head,

603
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.760
you just kick the ball you know, they

604
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.420
don't see the basketball, they don't see the

605
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.480
basketball they're checking their head, on their mind

606
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.760
they just check the basketball that's the difference,

607
00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.220
for me, for me some people do the

608
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.260
talks, I tell them they don't have a

609
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.440
pre, I'm not sure what they want to

610
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.420
do some kind of curvature angle they want

611
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.760
to take, some kind of pre-calculation they

612
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.120
want to do, which I call look ahead

613
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.040
calculation you know, the AI must do that

614
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.580
for me, but you know they just do

615
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.000
the talks basically, do I know do I

616
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.020
know what, do I know do I know

617
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.300
ahead of time what I want to do,

618
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.260
before I do it so it's like a

619
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.740
meta-system a meta-cognition system, do I

620
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:27.980
know what I'm going to do how I'm

621
00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.100
going to do it before I do it

622
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.960
do I have enough information to do that

623
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.260
thing effectively which is called the post-demo

624
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.260
cost function which is like a, I know

625
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.880
enough to do a state you know to

626
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.020
act on it but as someone else, basically,

627
00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.040
my one is like I have two basically,

628
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.820
I think this is my one is a

629
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.540
visual monologue so I'm in a monologue, a

630
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.740
visual auditory monologue, so basically I see, because

631
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.820
you know when I play basketball I can

632
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.040
calculate a lot of patterns and predict things

633
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.320
ahead of time you know, if I'm in

634
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.200
a flow state and I know whatever is

635
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.080
going on I can get that, I think

636
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.620
it's called three three groups based on the

637
00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:12.780
organisation you know, just by, behind the net

638
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.240
you know, one, three, three pointers you know,

639
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.420
just on the midway line you know, those

640
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.540
are three pointers you can get three pointers

641
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.920
to my team free the hook, because that's

642
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.580
my ontology, that's my known, I really know

643
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.840
what I'm going to do I really predicted

644
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.900
this happening, I really calculated, it's not like

645
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.840
I'm being a visual monologue, I can see

646
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.380
ahead of time, I did act on it

647
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.060
it's kind of powerful actually, because you know

648
00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.960
that means I'm in the flow state I

649
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:40.440
am, I'm working coherently I know how this

650
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.120
system works, you know, whether it's basketball or

651
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.860
like any dribbling, it's a sport you got

652
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.200
the ontology monologue so basically, the ontology monologue

653
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
is like for me, I think A, B,

654
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.600
C if he does A, I do C

655
00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.680
then I'm going to get the ball at

656
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.120
D which is the A, B, C if

657
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.000
he goes to A, then I go to

658
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.100
B if A, if player A comes to

659
00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.880
player 1 comes to me, at B I

660
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.660
go to B, 3 which is like the

661
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.760
third question even then, when he leaves me,

662
00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.600
on the centre I go to C, get

663
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:17.080
to C which is 3 points up, C2

664
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.340
which is 3 points and then shoot, but

665
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.440
that's all words in my head like you

666
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.740
know, and then I find the ball, because

667
00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:26.000
you know, I really calculate that thing, and

668
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.100
I think I just shoot the ball and

669
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.680
I get the 3 points up and I

670
00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.800
win the game, or score a point and

671
00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.880
the course continues, you know so you know,

672
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:35.140
it's like I've historically understand the scenario in

673
00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.120
real time because I have meta information, I

674
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.840
have a commission already about what's going to

675
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.960
happen, you know because I don't need to

676
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.040
wait to act on my meta condition, my

677
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.720
process my ability to act, you know I

678
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.560
just already have the insight of that state

679
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:52.960
surreal, in a surreal way we can interpret

680
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.680
phenomenologically lensing the principle as a protocol for

681
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.200
the task we're going to do and that

682
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.660
task is done, you know and then basically,

683
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.740
this thing I'm saying to you is the

684
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.340
way I work, the visual and the auditory,

685
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:08.760
they can be both at the same time

686
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.360
like normally when the genes are much easier,

687
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.400
but that's in my mind and then I

688
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.600
got the open sense one so basically, oh,

689
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.700
I think my pen is done ok, it's

690
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.920
almost done, basically the open sense matrix 5

691
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:31.640
senses, sight sight, smell sense touch and sight,

692
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:42.060
smell sense, touch sight, sense touch

693
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:52.340
feel, touch sight, smell eyes, nose, mouth or

694
00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.000
taste, taste basically, I have to start a

695
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.920
new one now because my auto, yes, finish

696
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.800
I'm going to say wait a bit, ok,

697
00:26:58.900 --> 00:26:59.900
let me just check what I want basically,

698
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.140
yes yes, I've got a sight, smell taste,

699
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:13.020
touch taste, touch one, two sight my 5

700
00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.680
senses you know, what is 5 senses around

701
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.260
me is an IK, my observation of the

702
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.240
IK principles and the K principles my action

703
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.180
on the K which like the first kind

704
00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.420
of matter is how it affects me or

705
00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.280
like me, even the one doing the touch

706
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.360
and how it affects the other person because

707
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.320
I don't really care about the opponent which

708
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.400
is called the open sense matrix if I'm

709
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.720
playing basketball you know, how I, how I

710
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.080
how I, how I, how I do a

711
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.060
combo the game, because the combo is you

712
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.880
have to see the combo then activate or

713
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.080
have to touch something touch your input or

714
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.820
get some kind of confirmation from the input

715
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.660
and then do the combo and do the

716
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:51.680
move you know, it's like you know, that's

717
00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.620
the observer obviously, this is just like an

718
00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.020
observer consumer model, observer user model for the

719
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.220
sight so I can see something and I

720
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.240
can act and that's something I see, I

721
00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.420
can smell something and then taste, that's something

722
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.620
you know, it can be like a bi

723
00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.140
-pattern that for sensory for AI cooking, but

724
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:13.040
open sense sensory matrix is about this, like

725
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.860
you know, seamless look-ahead ontology for direct

726
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:19.260
and biological vision in real time, for UVR

727
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.180
post-life state resolution you know, if there

728
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.400
is a post-life quantum quantum quantum equivalent

729
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.060
for quantum computers such as Hallmark gates for

730
00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.980
like signal state, is there something that I

731
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.300
can mirror to compute ahead of time, because

732
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.940
I see, I look before I see you

733
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.620
know, something I can use to tailor this

734
00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:41.220
to myself for that ontological work I'm going

735
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.640
to do VR Philharmonic Lensing as a key

736
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:50.440
protocol based on the coherent infrastructure ok, guys,

737
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.820
this video, I want you guys to use

738
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.180
this video, I'm just trying to explain to

739
00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.440
you me, me only, you know, if you

740
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.560
want to understand what I'm saying to you,

741
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.280
just understand me, and see how we can

742
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.100
understand other people if you want to go

743
00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.200
there but, you know, I want you guys

744
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.400
to try to, like, be honest to me

745
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.920
and see what you guys can do, ok

746
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.480
guys, thank you very much, I'm going to

747
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.920
try to share this video now, thank you

748
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.540
very much thank you very much for my

749
00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.440
thing oh, thank you very much, done and

750
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.060
this one's done well, this one should be

751
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.680
done now, and I'll stop this one now,

752
00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.000
I'm gone
