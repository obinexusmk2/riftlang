Okay, let's go. I'll take AI. Okay, this is my video. 

Okay, it should work. 30 minutes. Okay, basically, this video is very important, so it's like, you know, all my stuff, you know.

Okay, guys, so this video is on biological informatics. Oh, it's just taken... Oh, it's recording now. Okay, so basically, this video is on biological informatics, which is like, sustainable information, or student information, it's a programme for the sort of an internet, you know, artefact that you can, you know, but because I'm autistic, ADHD, asperge, disability, basically, this one is very personal to me. 

It's like, you know, who is an Amity? This is ontology. What's my role? What's my purpose? What's my task? You know, I'm going to film a few videos, but I'm just going to make you one. You know, I think it's a language that everything I'm working on anyway, you know. 

If you remember the wheel initiative, like, you know, the wheel, you're the perfect, you know, it's basically, oh, my initiatives are with the axioms. Like, the wheel, it's like, you know, you are perfect, you know, but the system is broken, so you can use those as pounds from this, and the customer give you a house, you know, and have the skills with 14. But you are perfect, you know, that's the axioms of the initiatives, you know, because, you know, there are flutes that are not like, they're not biassed, they're just there, you know, just things that we do, but through, but we have to frame them, you know, from a reference, okay. 

So, basically, I'm talking to you guys, if you're not joining initiatives, but, you know, I don't really speak to you guys. Anyway, so, basically, my video here. So, the first initiative was the wheel. 

Now, the other one, I was like, I did rediscovery. So, who's me if I seek to cancel through the 30 million pounds? I'm not poor anymore. I wear diamonds, I wear rings, but, you know, I need to build, and that's what my business opening represents. 

The rebuilding of my personality, myself, solving the problems that bug me in the past, because I had to, because I had to enter the system, you know, I have the system, I have the brain, because I'm a man, so 2% has gender freedom, which is kind of a bioformatics enquiry. So, basically, my PhD is in ontology, ontological, the knowing of the self, the mind, who you are, me, myself, and I, and, like, you know, building ontological vision, probabilistic systems, I know what to do, I can act on what to do, you know, they don't need to hear. Now, we have this, too. 

Okay, basically, this one is very important for me. So, basically, so, if I'm, basically, if the jargon is in my mind, if I'm talking to my mind, you know, I see the jargon in my mind, and I make a replica of the juggernaut from the world in my mind, you know, that juggernaut is my, is my mother through the mind, you know, how does my mind work with this information? Because, you know, if the copy of the juggernaut from the fan fiction is in my head, and I see the juggernaut, you know, but it's in my head, you know, am I still me, you know, I think it's kind of a problem, you know, because, you know, I can have, you have all the, I'm going to read the version, I'm going to read the version, I see everything in my head, I almost knew myself and I in my head, there's no one else there, just, like, I'm trying to navigate systems that are, that's kind of, like, imaginative, pictures, see myself in the pictures, see myself moving about myself, but, you know, for me, it's like, you know, I can learn something in my head, I can practise images in my head, like, you know, if I want to show you a basketball, I can do a technique in basketball, I can check it, like, you know, if I see, if I see an image, I see, like, me checking a hoop to a net, you know, me checking a basketball to a net, I can do, like, five times, I can do, I can get it, like, four times perfect, you know, depending on the range and distance, but, you know, because it's not isomorphic to the system, I'm building out, because, you know, those are some new ways to learn about the promotion, new strategies that are very down, like, then we practise with that imaging, like, you know, like, you know, image recursion. So, basically, this information is very important to you. 

So, basically, on my problem with systems, kind of new divergence and artistic, I'm going to give you the, this is what I'm doing, you know, so, basically, this video is for me to give you guys my view, my myself, my image stuff, you know, because, you know, I'm doing my PhD and if I don't do it, you know, properly, you know, you guys do not lie on my vision, then it will all come to trouble. So, basically, there are, for me, I know there are four types of main people, the people that have no perception of what they're doing, no perceptual membrane, they just have, they have no bubble, but they have a bubble, you know, they basically have a bubble around them, but they have that bubble, and it's not physical, they can't, it's not like in their head, it's just they are, but they are, the bubble is not, keeps them conscious, they don't know, they don't know where the bubble, you know, just thinking everything, it's just action. So, basically, everything they do, so, if I'm, if I'm, like, one of them, I would just try to, I could never see an image in my head when I try to do a basketball, because, you know, it's nothing to see, just practise the basketball, me checking the ball in the real world and checking into the hoop or the net. 

There we go, or processing on baseball, or sporting activity, you know, and I get better by documenting the, in the real world, you know, there's no, there's no, you know, inner self to that, outer, there's no, there's no, like, you know, world I can create in my head to, like, or instead to connect with my head to get that thing out faster, better, or, you know, like, you know, all my epiphanies are documented in the real world, there are no bridges, you know, but, you know, there's lots of roots compared to, I mean, so, basically, I am a visual monologue, I'm an inner monologue, but I'm not this one, you know, my brain wouldn't let it, like, it hurts my brain, you know, for some reason. For me, my senses are, I would say, the worst senses, because I see everything around me, everything, but, you know, I see myself, I feel myself, but I have an inner self, inner self, my soul, my heart, I have a bit longing, so, basically, for me, I think that aliens are, like, certain, like, genes or something, I don't really know, but for me, I have a visual monologue, and all that means to me is, like, you know, I can practise basketball, or, as I'm told, I'll have a football in my head, you know, just go to the ball, like, blah, and practise some kind of move, you know, and I can still get that same performance, or better, you know, because in my head, I'm compressing the world, I make myself better, but, you know, the, you know, if I want something that's better, but, you know, the real world is just better for me, because it's, I think, just simulated or emulated, you know, I just need to just do it, you know, you know, so I'm saying that's the kind of legacy, but, you know, I do get better anyway, I do it, if I do practise correctly, and I do it, and you do this on those, or the football, the rules, you know, this I'm actively doing, like, writing it down, the comments, you know, watching the videos, everything, and the reward, you know, then I can, oh, no, no, I was continuing from my world, so, basically, this is a foul, it's a foul, okay, basically, number one second, let's start a video now, guys, just one second, guys, and then try to solve this problem ontologically, so let me just see what, I can do it, I'll resume, okay, perfect, I got six minutes, I thought, fine, okay, okay, okay, basically, my video started, I got a recording it, temp, close that, okay, basically, go for video, so, guys, so, basically, this one's very important to me, so, basically, guys, this video is very important to me, I'll just start again, because, you know, the one, I have to upload the one, because, you know, there's no part of this video, but, you know, it just turned out, it's my space, my system, anyway, I don't have to worry about it now, that's what I did, so, basically, this video is very important to me, it's for a PhD, basically, you know, it reminds me of ontology, which is my ontological vision, intelligence infrastructure, conscious systems, those that are limited to accident on behalf, and these dimensional game theory, with open sense metrics, which is like the sight, touch, feel, taste, and hearing, which is like the sight senses, and the sixth sense, they're, like, you know, they're phenomenological, or PRP sense, like, you know, things they observe from the world, you know, they act in that too, so, the AI systems are built in the, or something, you know, they have to use that sense, open sense, open access, open access, which is a bit of open sense compliance, for, you know, typical people, but it's really the first, you know, this one is very important, let me just start by giving you the take for my recordings, so, basically, open sense metrics, you go like the IKE principle, or the inverse kinematics principle, or the inverse kinematics principle, or the inverse kinematics, you know, the ears, which are the sensor systems, which we've been testing, we've been testing, like, you know, input, and he has to handle it accordingly, whether it's, like, a, like, you know, slow down for a person crossing the road, sensing that person, seeing it through his lenses, or, like, or, like, or, like, or, like, or the key principle, like, you know, kinematics has to slow down, because there's an object in the way, but you have to adjust for that, for the person, you know, it has to take time, when it's a wall or something, it doesn't really matter, but it has to slow down, so it doesn't crash the car, you know, like, a system that's ontological, he knows what he's doing, he knows he knows nothing, you start with, and he barely knows what he's doing, he then takes a piece of information from the robot, so, basically, one thing to use, like, you know, my EI, and she has to use an EI system, see what he did, see, what did that mean, to observe, and then cover from that, based on active senses, system, you know, observe a consumer, senses that mean something to the EI, you know, if an EI system is good for you, you don't want an EI system to burn your food, so you want an EI system to be, like, you know, noise short, you know, basically, I'm saying that I'm going to get old, actually, I don't want to get old, I don't want to get old, I hate it, you know, basically, I'm just scared of getting old, you know, trying to preserve myself in the best way possible, you know, if I can start using the EI system for me, I'll do it just to make my life easier, I'm going to be stressed, you know, and things like that, you know, I have my ontological vision home, based on my consciousness, encoded into it, you know, my care for my care, you know, I make care for everyone else, because I'm the best cook, you know, things like that, that's a safety critical, like, food, do you want to burn the food, burn the house, for example, you know, you must know what he's doing, you know, it's ontological, it must be knowing what he's doing and learning from it, we are buying formatics, with a score in, like, a score in a heuristic, okay, it's a short evaluation, okay, accessibility, okay, so basically, this man called a marvel juggernaut, so basically, he's a marvel juggernaut, basically, to marvel juggernaut thing, you know, if it's unstoppable, you know, but, you know, he's unstoppable, yes, but, you know, I'm seeing him in my head, you know, but he's in my head, you know, basically, he's real, but, you know, I start seeing him, I start hallucinating him, but, you know, I don't hallucinate him, so, I'm seeing him, the juggernaut says in my head, you know, it's not my head, you know, but, you know, what does it mean for a juggernaut to be in my head and be unstoppable, to be unstoppable, for, you know, run through anything, it just gets the momentum going, you run through whatever, you know, he's having the speed, that's the thing, it's like, you know, once uniform division, you're going to have to concentrate, you can run faster, faster, you can fall faster, faster, but, you know, once he starts running, you can't stop him, you know, it's a certain speed, you know, it's like, you know, you have to, like, sweetest god, you know, how are you hacking this god if you mind, you know, you know, because, you know, that's going to give him power, you know, and they say to me, you know, for me, you know, being a marvel juggernaut in my head, it's like that, you know, it's like, if I'm, if I'm going to stop on my head, you know, and it's not me, is that thing the new analogy, is that thing that has to do with my body, my mind, my soul, you know, because it's unstoppable force, you know, you know, but it's like, it's like, you know, it's unstoppable, I don't really know, it's unstoppable, to the duality of a unstoppable force, so basically, it's unstoppable, unmovable, almost unstoppable, basically, he's unstoppable, but unmovable, so does that mean that, you know, if this guy is real, and I haven't been mind controlled to see the juggernaut, and that mind controls someone else's control of my mind, because, you know, the juggernaut can control my mind, because, you know, I think it's real, you know, but then I have no real, because, you know, every time I think about the juggernaut, oh, the juggernaut is here, and I get control, my mind control, you know, things like that, it's not me, that's not me doing it, it's someone else doing it, but, you know, it's not real to me, it's real to me, because, you know, I have been brainwashed to believe it's real, but, you know, the unstoppable force, I'm the immovable object, so basically, I'm right now, I'm immovable, because, you know, I haven't got the juggernaut in my head, you know, it's like that, you know, so how does the mind and body encoder, you know, what does that mean to be unstoppable, immovable, you know, these are the unstoppable forces, the immovable objects, what's the reaction there, what happens there, you know, especially at the emulation simulation, you know, basically, my system starts to hallucinate, or like, it starts to get something, which is, I don't understand, you know, I don't understand, you know, after really, that's really the information co-humanity, you know, because, you know, I don't understand what I'm saying, you know, actually, what is like an image of some other olive oil being, you know, you know, what is, like, you know, is trying to access other worlds, what's in the mind, you know, things like that, I'm no worried about it, I'm just worried about how the EI interprets it, you know, interprets the information that I don't understand, that I've programmed to interpret, you know, but it doesn't interpret that from I see everything around me, you know, but, you know, basically, I'm saying, yeah, there's no hallucination, whenever hallucination is this scenario, but, you know, if it does not hallucinate it, then what is that information that I can classify it, so what's he trying to classify, you know, what it sees in his mind, or, you know, what is cooking, you know, what is doing, what he's trying to navigate, you know, because it's ontological, just to know what it sees, just to navigate it here. He doesn't know, he just asks me, you know, because, you know, he may be, but, you know, I love EI, the way we're experimenting by itself and doing that kind of thing, you know, it's our chatbot, and the EI system is a chatbot, and the chatbot just, like, doesn't call me back, it's not ontological, because, you know, I may be depressed or anything, I may be, you know, I may be Mars or something, but the EI system says, oh, you work some, my vision for this is, like, you know, are you working more money, you don't call this the EI for a week, and the EI system says, hey, are you all right, mate, are you okay to talk today, are you, are you okay, you know, my ontology is, like, you know, it cares for you, it's you, it's you, it's you, you know, it's like, you know, it's like in you, you, okay, what comes to mind, it can be, that's what I'm saying, you know, what does it mean for you, in some days to know yourself enough, and have a relationship with you, that's, like, the EI system, the EI system says, yeah, you, because, you know, we have an oral birth certificate, you know, we have a UEI, you know, and that EI will learn from you, you know, it's, you know, personal account, and personal services, it doesn't need to, you don't need to see it, you don't need to see it anymore, it's just you, it's just you, because, you know, you know, it's from you, it's just you, if you don't wanna just turn off, but, you know, just have the version of turn off, you need to turn off because when you enter the window, your oral cell card, you know, your birth cell card, you know, then you got this here, basically, my, I'm wondering, it's because of, you know, this is something that's unstoppable, am I the only one unstoppable, you know, it can't be, you know, there's no, it's not, it's not unstoppable, but then it's, all the things that are But that means there's something that there's many things that are unstoppable, because you know, unstoppable Or it could mean there's nothing that's unstoppable but you, because you know, you are the phenomenologist, you only want to do it, you know Be unstoppable, because you know, he's the most unstoppable in this universe, but I'm the immeasurable object in my universe That's my world, my perception of him. 

So you think, if he tries to run me over, you know, he will just be wasting his time, you know, because you know Actually, he can't stop me, because I'm real, he's not, you know, that's what I say, but he's not that intelligent, basically My mind is like that, so I can imagine all the stuff in my world, my opportunity can't effectively affect me, because I don't hallucinate it I don't make it up. It's really something I can control and like control very well So back to it, so buying so much this relationship title, so we go, let's talk about this with basically, the term isotope in my framework, quasi-state, which is quantum superposition Basically, you go to github.com such quasi, that's the quantum superposition isotopes, you know, quasi github.com quasi isotope superposition isotope, because you know, it's like a based on quantum system So basically, for every proton you have, there is a positive recharge, because positive recharge and it's probably open to positive recharge, you know But the opposite one is negatron, that means it's all negatron charge Now, these two are just put over, you know, in quantum states, we have like quarks, blue ones you know, what are these things I don't understand but they have isotope slayers, you know, they can be opposites in various, they do the same thing the same ontology, have the same ontology, you know, row types, but you know, there are different models of ontology and for different ecosystems, like the systems that you model you know, they are different, because they are just like a biological sustainable for different ecosystems but they have the, you know, alkali-axis principle, you know basically, they have some kind of encoding that's sustainable for them you know, because they are in the world of new physics, different kind of physics or that process, excuse me, again, all kinds of different kinds of rules in the universe but you know, attraction can be different, poor, but you know, quasi-state is quantum superposition isotope reposition is, you know, explain the kind of properties that do the same thing over quantum principles formally, of course but you know, what I'm saying is, let's show about the waves, its energy actually, for example, I can have a wire of charger, I can send a wire of signal, coherently and I have the same thing as an actual current, you know, that's what I'm saying because I don't have to like, if I get a wire right now, I don't have a wire if I get this wire, this is a wire thing, and this is a charger but my phone, I don't charge my phone now, so this wire here doesn't really work so this wire here is a charger, it's like a USB type C charger this one is broken here, so if I plug this in here, I shoot the charger here and get it out there, you know, current, current, current, current, current going through this wire, but it's not broken, so I can't use it now on my phone, but you know, it's like, you know, it goes through you plug in this little socket, it goes click, you put it here in components, then it goes in so this wire, it has the electrical charge going through it it comes, basically goes, you can see the electrical and it actually gets excited, I get a portable charge and then it leaves the charge when it becomes negative and it flows back the other way, because, you know, there's no way to go unless it's down, it's got more energy, down the coil and you can go back, you know, because, you know, it's a cycle of electricality but this one, so I can send them the same representation as a signal, the waveform like, you know, as a waveform in this digital current, you know like, as I'm going to go through the digital system one other system, you know, the digital wave that has some effect to the, like, a bit of really discharge the same thing, but that current is the same thing as the current the current doesn't, it's wireless, and this was not wireless it doesn't break down, actually so what I'm saying to you, stop looking at me, fucking guy! STOP LOOK AT ME! what I'm saying to you, guy, because someone's dead just look at me in my fucking car, I said I'm your boyfriend so what I'm saying to you is like the electrical current is the same as the as the electrical wave but, you know, it goes back the direction so it can be, there can be many electrical positions if you're using a current, if you're using a particular biological sustainability, it doesn't really matter the abusive wave format, you know as long as that codec, let's define it as like a a kind of codec, information, it's the same thing you represent through the medium the medium is just the spectrum the medium is just the wire the current goes into the coil, or the wire but it will work together as an electrical system via electrical electric, which is like a magnetic which is like the north magnetic, you know the magnetic poles of the world, you know that create the field, the current field around the earth or the globe, you know that's like, you know, stop solar radiation coming in and out of the world you know, it goes through, you know because you know, that's, you have to get into the magnetic field to attract debris, but you know it doesn't really cause much, you know so that's actually top for you you know, for me, this is like very important because, you know, if I can show there's an isomer, there's an isomer across a set of three, try try a biopattern that, then I've solved my problem which is like signing biological informatics based on a pair, basically one pair will be like using an electric charger and then another pair will be like a magnetic wave that's like a natural magnetic wave in the field in the radio waves, microwaves, infrared visible light, ultraviolet actually cameras, you can do the same thing for the waves here, and the WOMO waves will be like the people, so this can upload, download, and WOMO consume, observe consumers you know, pair to pair to pair for real world heuristic measure for the mind, for the G for the model, the consciousness in the model as a topology thing that's possible that can have a variance, basically this try that has so I can present the magnetic spectrum more way, the WOMO system, you can have the opposite infrared quasi-opposite actually, typically in a quantum system do it in a so basically, so I control all the system, and show that the system does what it does, without breaking down the whole ecosystem you know, there's a built-in, you know I can have it, it's like you know, like like you know, can't start something I don't like, even I measure because I'm being like a sustainable housing infrastructure, you know it reminds me of the mind and the brain, I don't know the thing, basically so basically, I'm going to give you my basketball analogy so basically, in my mind there's no perception, and so basically something is in my mind there's no perception of the network there's no perception of the talk no ontological look I had then you know, of pre-emcession and just the doing of the thoughts that's one person my, I think my let me check let me check oh, I got basically, ontology, basically essentially, there's no some people, basically there's no, you don't see a football in their head, you just kick the ball you know, they don't see the basketball, they don't see the basketball they're checking their head, on their mind they just check the basketball that's the difference, for me, for me some people do the talks, I tell them they don't have a pre, I'm not sure what they want to do some kind of curvature angle they want to take, some kind of pre-calculation they want to do, which I call look ahead calculation you know, the AI must do that for me, but you know they just do the talks basically, do I know do I know what, do I know do I know ahead of time what I want to do, before I do it so it's like a meta-system a meta-cognition system, do I know what I'm going to do how I'm going to do it before I do it do I have enough information to do that thing effectively which is called the post-demo cost function which is like a, I know enough to do a state you know to act on it but as someone else, basically, my one is like I have two basically, I think this is my one is a visual monologue so I'm in a monologue, a visual auditory monologue, so basically I see, because you know when I play basketball I can calculate a lot of patterns and predict things ahead of time you know, if I'm in a flow state and I know whatever is going on I can get that, I think it's called three three groups based on the organisation you know, just by, behind the net you know, one, three, three pointers you know, just on the midway line you know, those are three pointers you can get three pointers to my team free the hook, because that's my ontology, that's my known, I really know what I'm going to do I really predicted this happening, I really calculated, it's not like I'm being a visual monologue, I can see ahead of time, I did act on it it's kind of powerful actually, because you know that means I'm in the flow state I am, I'm working coherently I know how this system works, you know, whether it's basketball or like any dribbling, it's a sport you got the ontology monologue so basically, the ontology monologue is like for me, I think A, B, C if he does A, I do C then I'm going to get the ball at D which is the A, B, C if he goes to A, then I go to B if A, if player A comes to player 1 comes to me, at B I go to B, 3 which is like the third question even then, when he leaves me, on the centre I go to C, get to C which is 3 points up, C2 which is 3 points and then shoot, but that's all words in my head like you know, and then I find the ball, because you know, I really calculate that thing, and I think I just shoot the ball and I get the 3 points up and I win the game, or score a point and the course continues, you know so you know, it's like I've historically understand the scenario in real time because I have meta information, I have a commission already about what's going to happen, you know because I don't need to wait to act on my meta condition, my process my ability to act, you know I just already have the insight of that state surreal, in a surreal way we can interpret phenomenologically lensing the principle as a protocol for the task we're going to do and that task is done, you know and then basically, this thing I'm saying to you is the way I work, the visual and the auditory, they can be both at the same time like normally when the genes are much easier, but that's in my mind and then I got the open sense one so basically, oh, I think my pen is done ok, it's almost done, basically the open sense matrix 5 senses, sight sight, smell sense touch and sight, smell sense, touch sight, sense touch feel, touch sight, smell eyes, nose, mouth or taste, taste basically, I have to start a new one now because my auto, yes, finish I'm going to say wait a bit, ok, let me just check what I want basically, yes yes, I've got a sight, smell taste, touch taste, touch one, two sight my 5 senses you know, what is 5 senses around me is an IK, my observation of the IK principles and the K principles my action on the K which like the first kind of matter is how it affects me or like me, even the one doing the touch and how it affects the other person because I don't really care about the opponent which is called the open sense matrix if I'm playing basketball you know, how I, how I how I, how I, how I do a combo the game, because the combo is you have to see the combo then activate or have to touch something touch your input or get some kind of confirmation from the input and then do the combo and do the move you know, it's like you know, that's the observer obviously, this is just like an observer consumer model, observer user model for the sight so I can see something and I can act and that's something I see, I can smell something and then taste, that's something you know, it can be like a bi-pattern that for sensory for AI cooking, but open sense sensory matrix is about this, like you know, seamless look-ahead ontology for direct and biological vision in real time, for UVR post-life state resolution you know, if there is a post-life quantum quantum quantum equivalent for quantum computers such as Hallmark gates for like signal state, is there something that I can mirror to compute ahead of time, because I see, I look before I see you know, something I can use to tailor this to myself for that ontological work I'm going to do VR Philharmonic Lensing as a key protocol based on the coherent infrastructure ok, guys, this video, I want you guys to use this video, I'm just trying to explain to you me, me only, you know, if you want to understand what
